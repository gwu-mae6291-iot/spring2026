**Exciting news from MAE6291: Internet of Things [Spring 2026]**

* **Anurag Bhatnagar, CEO and Co-founder, ShiftAltCap - A boutique tech-investment banking firm from New Delhi, India** delivered a guest lecture titled, "Innovation @ IOT + Human Behaviour + Finance" on April 16, 2025.
  + Anurag Bhatnagar gave the class a unique perspective of behavioural economics using concepts like 'nudge' that will continue to inform the IoT practioners and users to design and promote IoT applications. 
  + See [Anurag Bhatnagar's lecture](Week12-AnuragBhatnagar-ShiftAltCap-Lecture.qmd) for details.
  + See [Anurag Bhatnagar's LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leobhatnagar/)
  + **Thank you, Anurag. We hope to see you again next year!**

* **Miya Liu, from the Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME), GWU,** and her colleagues **won the Best Senior Design Award at the NEBEC 2025 conference held in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering**
  + Their project titled, "Self-regulating Warming System for Dorrance Hook Prosthetic" incorparted an IoT system to measure temperature associated with the prosthetic with increased accuracy and access to data. 
  + Miya Liu graciously acknowldeged MAE6291: IoT for Engineers on the poster.
  + **Thank you, Miya Liu. I hope to see more BME students in the successive offerrings on MAE6291: IoT for Engineers!**

### Course description
<div class="row">
 <div class="column">
 The Internet of Things (IoT) is perceived as a collection of smart, connected devices with the ability to send and receive data; “internet” encapsulates connectivity and “things” are devices (electronic or mechanical) that can be adapted toward connectivity. 

 There is an alternative perception of IoT, as a design methodology that facilitates interoperability and connectivity of physical systems. Edge computing is a strategy for localized analysis of data, ahead in the pipeline of powerful data center- or cloud-based post-processing.

This course explores these aspects of IoT framework and expands it with edge computing ideology via practical and hands-on exposure. Students will be exposed to the IoT framework using a variety of sensors, IoT automation and connectivity in **$\mu$-labs** (micro-labs) that incorporate the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer) and Python programming language. 

The students will learn about how IoT with edge computing capability is going to be the backbone of the Industry 4.0.
