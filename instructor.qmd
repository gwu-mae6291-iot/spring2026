    <td width="70%">
      
      Prof. Kartik V. Bulusu is an Associate Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, Washington DC. 
      
      He designed taught a cross-disciplinary course titled, Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing with applications in cyber-physical systems and speech processing. 
      
      In addition, he developed courses for first year engineering students on the engineering applications of Raspberry Pi, Python programming and mobile App development inspired by social innovation potential during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      
      His research interests span the areas of human health and sustainable energy with focus on mechanics of biological fluids, low-cost energy technologies and applications of wavelet transforms. His current research work on biofluid dynamics of the cardiovasculature, rheology of biological fluids and applications of wavelet transforms has been supported by NSF and the Center for Biomimetics and Bioinspired Engineering (CBBE), GWU.  
      
      He developed a wavelet transform-based computational code (PIVlet) for the analysis of complex vortical patterns encountered in arterial blood flow. He has extensive knowledge of experimental fluid mechanics and non-invasive measurement techniques such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), particle image velocimetry (PIV), schlieren imagery, magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) and molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV). Dr. Bulusu was recognized with the ASME Best Paper Award by the Advanced Energy Systems Division (AESD) Heat Pump Technical Committee and William and Louise Corcoron Award for contributing to the intellectual and social life of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, GWU.

## Eliot Hunter (Tech Advocate / Teaching Assistant / The friend you want in this course!)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="70%">
      
      I am a mechanical engineering graduate student at The George Washington University, specializing in energy systems with a focus on distributed energy resources, microgrids, and sustainable infrastructure. I am currently completing a master’s thesis centered on thermal management and heat transfer, applying advanced modeling and analysis techniques to better understand and optimize system-level thermal behavior. Alongside my studies, I serve as a Teaching Assistant and Research Fellow, supporting instruction and contributing to applied engineering research.

      My academic and professional experience spans energy engineering, building automation systems, and data-driven analysis. I have previously worked as an Energy Engineer Intern at Southland Industries and as a Building Automation Systems Engineer Intern at the Federal Reserve Board, gaining hands-on experience with real-world energy systems and controls. I have strong technical skills in CAD, thermal systems analysis, and programming, with proficiency in Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Java, and geospatial and visualization tools.
