## Academic Integrity Code

Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others without crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of information. You are not allowed to collaborate on the home works and lab assignments; for programming projects and hardware lab assignments, you can work in teams only if they are designated as team projects (labs). Unless otherwise specified, you cannot search for solutions or code on the web – but you can use any code that is included in the textbook or lecture notes (but please cite them). I will be using a SW tool that checks for program code similarities – any pair of programs or written reports with greater than 10% similarity will be closely examined.

The Office of Academic Integrity maintains a permanent record of the violation.
More information is available from the Office of Academic Integrity at <https://students.gwu.edu/cesa>. The University’s “Guide of Academic Integrity in Online Learning Environments” is available at <https://students.gwu.edu/cesa>. Contact information: rights@gwu.edu or 202-994-6757.
