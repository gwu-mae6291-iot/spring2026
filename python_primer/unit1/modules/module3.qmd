## Objectives
By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Practice working with Boolean expressions and variables.
- Practice examples with strings
- Start to use built-in functions
- Delve into the notion of <em>type</em>

## 3.0 Boolean variables: two examples
Recall:

- An integer variable takes on values like 5 and -33:
    
    ```python
    x = 5
    y = -33
    ```
- A floating-point variable stores real numbers like:

    ```python
    x = 5.0014
    y = -33.3333334
    ```
- A string variable stores strings or chars, as in:

    ```python
    s = 'hello'
    c = 'z'
    ```
- A <b>boolean variable</b> stores one of two values: `True` or `False`

For example:
```python
a = True
print(a)

b = False
print(b)

c = not a
print(c)

d = a or b
print(d)

e = a and b
print(e)
```

### Exercise 3.1

Type up the above in `my_boolean_example.py`.

**Submit your program `my_boolean_example.py`.**

<!-- Use comments (text followed by ‘#’ symbol) to report your output in the python-file.  -->
:::

:::{.callout-note}
<!-- - The reserved words `True` and `False` are used in their usual sense. -->

- The words `True` and `False` are <em>reserved words</em> in Python.
- A boolean variable can store only one of these values:
  
    ```python
    a = True
    b = False
    ```
    - `True` and `False` start with uppercase alphabets.
    - The quote-delimited <em>strings</em> `'True'` and `'False'` are not the same as `True` and `False`. 

- Just as we could perform arithmetic on integer variables, so can we perform <em>boolean operations</em> on boolean variables.
- **The simplest one is <em>not</em> as shown below:**
    
    ```python
    a = True
    c = not a
    ```
    **Explanation about how the <em>not</em>-operation works:**

    - Since `a` has the value `True` then `not a` will have the value `False`
    - Thus, `c` will have the value `False`.


- **Similarly, <em>not</em>-operation can also be implemented as shown below**
    
    ```python
    a = False
    c = not a
    print(c)
    ```
    will print `True`.

- **Let us the consider <em>or</em>-operation:**
    
    ```python
    d = a or b
    ```
    **Explanation about how the <em>or</em>-operation works:**

    - `a or b` will be `True` when any one of the two i.e., a or b is `True`.
    - Another way to state it: `a or b` will be `False` only when both a and b are `False`.
    - The following table shows all the logical possibilities for the <em>or</em>-operation:
       <table border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
          <tr>
             <td> <b>a</b>  </td>
             <td> <b>b</b>  </td>
             <td> <b>d = a or b</b>  </td>
	    </tr>
          <tr>
             <td> False  </td>
             <td> False  </td>
             <td> False  </td>
	  </tr>
          <tr>
             <td> False  </td>
             <td> True  </td>
             <td> True  </td>
	  </tr>
          <tr>
             <td> True  </td>
             <td> True  </td>
             <td> True  </td>
	  </tr>
          <tr>
             <td> True  </td>
             <td> False  </td>
             <td> True  </td>
	  </tr>
       </table>


- **Let us the consider <em>and</em>-operation:**
    
    ```python
    e = a and b
    ```
    **Explanation about how the <em>and</em>-operation works:**

    - `a and b` will be True only when both are True.
    - The following table shows all the logical possibilities for the <em>and</em>-operation:
       <table border="2" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
          <tr>
             <td> <b>a</b>  </td>
             <td> <b>b</b>  </td>
             <td> <b>c = a and b</b>  </td>
	  </tr>
          <tr>
             <td> False  </td>
             <td> False  </td>
             <td> False  </td>
	  </tr>
          <tr>
             <td> False  </td>
             <td> True  </td>
             <td> False  </td>
	  </tr>
          <tr>
             <td> True  </td>
             <td> True  </td>
             <td> True  </td>
	  </tr>
          <tr>
             <td> True  </td>
             <td> False  </td>
             <td> False  </td>
	  </tr>
       </table>

Let's look at another example:
```python
a = True
b = True

a = not a       
x = a and b
y = a or b
print(x, y)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.2

Type up the above in `my_boolean_example2.py`. 

**Submit your program `my_boolean_example2.py`.**

:::

**The explanation of the above program is as shown below:**
  
- First, let's look at the following lines of code:
    
    ```python
    a = True
    b = True
    ```
    - Here, there are two boolean variables, each of which is assigned a (boolean) value.
    - Think of the variables as "boxes" in the usual way but as boxes that can hold only boolean values (`True` or `False`).

- Next, let's look at the following lines of code:
    
    ```python
    a = not a
    ```
    - Here, the value in `a` before this executes is `True`
    - So, `not a` is `False`.
    - This gets stored in `a`
    - So, after the statement executes `a` will have the value `False`.

- Further, let's look at the following lines of code:

    ```python
    x = a and b
    ```
    - We know that `a` has the value `False` in it, while `b` has the value `True`.
    - Thus, the `and` operator is applied to the values `False` and `True`.
    - You can picture this as: `False and True`.
    - What is the result? 
    - Similar to applying the "rules of multiplication" to two numbers, we apply the rules of <b>and</b> to `False` and `True`.
    ![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.3/boolean-and.png)
    - The result is: `False`.
    - Thus, the value `False` is assigned to the variable `x`.


- Finally, let's look at the following lines of code:
    
    ```python
    y = a or b
    ```
    Because `a` is now `False` and `b` is `True`, the result in y will be:
    ![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.3/boolean-or.png)




## 3.1 Combining Boolean operators
Consider
```python
a = True
b = False
c = True
u = (a and b) or (a or b)
v = (not u) or (not (b and c))
print(u, v)
```

Let's draw an <em>expression diagram</em> to help us understand what happens with the first expression:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.3/boolean-expr.png)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.4

Type up the above in `my_boolean_example3.py`.

**Submit your program `my_boolean_example3.py`.**

**Recommended but not required for submission in this exercise:** 
Draw an expression diagram to work out the result for the second expression (the value of v) above.
:::



Boolean expressions can be constructed with numeric variables and their comparison operators:
```python
k = 5
m = 3
n = 8
a = True
b = False

first = (m < k) and (n > k)
second = ( (k+m == n) or (k-m < 10) )
third = first and (not second)
fourth = first or a
print(first, second, third, fourth)
```

:::{.callout-note}
- Since the variable `m` is assigned the integer `3`, k is assigned the integer value `5`, the expression `(m < k)` in `first = (m < k) and (n > k)` evaluates to `True`.
    
<!--     ```python
    first = (m < k) and (n > k)
    ``` -->
    
- The variable `n` is assigned the integer value `8`.  Therefore, the expression `(n > k)` in `first = (m < k) and (n > k)` also evaluates to `True`.

- Thus, the resulting expression in line of code below,

    ```python
    first = (m < k) and (n > k)
    ```
    takes the following form:
    
    ```python
    first = True and True
    ```
   The above expression evaluates to `True` from the rules (the table) for <b>and</b>-operation.

### Exercise 3.6
Type up the above in `my_boolean_example4.py`.

**Submit your program `my_boolean_example4.py`.**

**Recommended but not required for submission in this exercise:** 
Draw an expression diagram to work out the result for the remaining three expressions above. 
:::

## 3.2 Using a Boolean variable
To see how a Boolean variable is used in practice, we will work through a somewhat elaborate example that will teach us other useful things.

Let's start with this program:
```python
def print_search_result(A, search_term):
    if search_term in A:
        print('Found ', search_term)

B = [15, 3, 23, 9, 14, 4, 6, 2]
print_search_result(B, 4)
```

In the above example program, the goal is to create a function that takes a list, and a search value (or search term) and looks inside the list to see if it exists.

Does the program work?

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false }
### Exercise 3.8

Type up the above program in `my_search_example.py` to confirm.

**Submit your program `my_search_example.py`.**
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- We have exploited the <b>in</b>-operator in Python to examine whether or not an element exists in a list:
    
    ```python
    if search_term in A:
    ```
- This will return either `True` or `False`.
- And Python does the <em>work</em> of traversing the list and peeking inside to see if value (4 in this case) is in the list.
:::

**Now consider the problem of also printing the position where it's found:**

```python
def print_search_result(A, search_term):
    for k in range(len(A)):
        if A[k] == search_term:
            print('Found', search_term, 'at position', k)

B = [15, 3, 23, 9, 14, 4, 6, 2]
print_search_result(B, 4)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.9

- To check if the above program works, type it up in `my_search_example2.py`. 

- Make any changes required to make sure that the program prints the position where element of the list is found.

**Submit your program `my_search_example2.py`.**
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- We are now traversing the list ourselves:
    
     ```python
    for k in range(len(A)):
    ```
    Here, the variable `k` will start at `0` and go up to the last index (one less than the length of the list).
- At each iteration, the program checks to see if the search term is equal to the list element at the current position (determined by `k`):
  
    ```python
    if A[k] == search_term:
    ```
    If the condition above evaluates to `True`, it means the program found the list element we are looking for.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.10
**There is nothing to submit in this exercise. However, it is important for you to complete it on your own to understand the execution of the program:** 

Consider the list and the user-defined function call as shown in the program below. 
```python
B = [15, 4, 23, 9, 14, 4, 6, 2]
print_search_result(B, 4)
```
Note that the function `print_search_result(B, 4)` was typed up in the previous exercise 3.9. 

Try tracing through the above program and also what happens when we instead have below.
```python
B = [15, 4, 23, 9, 14, 4, 6, 2]
print_search_result(B, 5)
```
:::

**What we'd like to do is print something when a search term is not found in the list.**

Consider the following program:
```python
def print_search_result(A, search_term):
    for k in range(len(A)):
        if A[k] == search_term:
            print('Found', search_term, 'at position', k)
    print('Not found:', search_term)

B = [15, 3, 23, 9, 14, 4, 6, 2]
print_search_result(B, 4)
print_search_result(B, 5)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.11

- Type up the above in `my_search_example3.py`.

- **Submit your program `my_search_example3.py`.**

**Recommended but not required for submission in this exercise:** 
Think through the execution of your program `my_search_example3.py` to see if it worked as intended. Explain to yourself what went wrong in the program.
:::

**Let's try another variation to see if we can improve the program `my_search_example3.py` as shown below:**
```python
def print_search_result(A, search_term):
    for k in range(len(A)):
        if A[k] == search_term:
            print('Found', search_term, 'at position', k)
        else:
            print('Not found:', search_term)

B = [15, 3, 23, 9, 14, 4, 6, 2]
print_search_result(B, 4)
print_search_result(B, 5)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.12
- Type up the above in `my_search_example4.py`.

- **Submit your program `my_search_example4.py`.**

**Recommended but not required for submission in this exercise:** 
Think through the execution of your program `my_search_example4.py` to see if it worked as intended. Explain to yourself what went wrong in the program.

<!-- Start by thinking through the execution to see if this worked. Then, type it up in `my_search_example4.py` to see. Use comments (text followed by ‘#’ symbol) to explain what went wrong in the python-file.  -->
:::

**We'll now see how a simple Boolean variable is commonly  used in these types of problems:**
```python
def print_search_result(A, search_term):
    found = False
    pos = -1
    for k in range(len(A)):
        if A[k] == search_term:
            found = True
            pos = k

    if found:
        print('Found', search_term, 'at position', pos)
    else:
        print('Not found:', search_term)

B = [15, 3, 23, 9, 14, 4, 6, 2]
print_search_result(B, 4)
print_search_result(B, 5)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.13
- Type up the above in `my_search_example5.py`.

- **Submit your program `my_search_example5.py`.**

**The following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 
Trace through the program `my_search_example5.py` to understand the execution of the  the above program. 
:::

## 3.3 Returning a True/False value
The most common use of <b>Boolean expressions</b> is to write functionz that return either `True` or `False`.

Suppose we want to determine whether or not (Hint: whether or not
&rArr; true or false) a list has a negative number:
```python
def has_negative(A):
    for k in A:
        if k < 0:
            return True
    return False

B = [2, 4, 8, -10]
print(has_negative(B))
C = [1, 3, 5]
print(has_negative(C))
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.14
- Type up the above in `my_search_negative.py`.

- **Submit your program `my_search_negative.py`.**

**The following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 
Trace through the program `my_search_negative.py` to understand the execution of the  the above program.
:::


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.15

In `my_search_negative2.py` complete the function below to identify whether or not a list has exactly two negative numbers:
```python
def has_two_negatives(A):
    # Write your code here

B = [2, 4, 8, -10]
print(has_two_negatives(B))  # Should print False
C = [1, -3, -5]
print(has_two_negatives(C))  # Should print True
D = [1, -3, -5, -7]
print(has_two_negatives(D))  # Should print False
```
**Submit your program `my_search_negative2.py`.**
:::

## 3.4 New topic: strings and slicing
It is common to want to pull out parts of strings.

For example, if the user in some application  types `'DC 20052'`, we may want just the zip code:
```python
s = 'DC 20052'
state = s[0:2]
zip = s[3:8]
print(state, zip)
```

**Explanation about how the <em>slicing in strings</em> works:**
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.3/slicing.png)

- The <em>slicing</em> expression `0:2` refers to all the characters of the string from the first (i.e.,the 0-th indexed) character up to the character before the one at position-2 (i.e., associated with index-1).
- Thus, `0:2` refers to characters at positions or indices `0` through `1`.
- Similarly, `3:8` refers to all the characterss from position- or index-`3` up to `7`.
- Slicing ranges are specified so that the left end is inclusive and the right end is exclusive:
- Thus, `3:8` means "including 3" and "excluding 8".
- Recall:
    - For any range of numbers like 3,4,5,6,7, <em>exclusive</em> would mean the numbers 4, 5, 6 (excluding 3, excluding 7).
    - <em>Inclusive</em> would include the ends: 3,4,5,6,7.


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.16

In `my_slicing.py` write code to extract the actual phone number (202-994-4000) from 
```python
s = 'phone: 202-994-4000'
# Write your code here
```

**Submit your program `my_slicing.py`.**
:::

**Slicing expressions work for lists in the same manner as strings:**
```python
A = ['may','the','force','be','with','you']
print(A[2:5])
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.18

- Before typing it up in `my_slicing2.py` try and guess what the above will print.

- Type up the program above in `my_slicing2.py`.

**Submit your program `my_slicing2.py`.**
:::

Let's look at slicing when we don't know the size:

- Consider the zipcode example where the 5-digit zip code may preceded by all kinds of text, as in:

    ```python
   'DC 20052'
   'District of Columbia, 20052'
   '20052'
   'My zip code is 20052'
    ```
- So, all we know is that the last 5 characters in the string need to be extracted.
- Then, we need to get the length of the string.
- Let's put this in a function:
    
    ```python
    def extract_zip(s):
        start = len(s) - 5
        end = len(s)
        return s[start:end]

    example1 = 'DC 20052'
    example2 = 'District of Columbia, 20052'
    example3 = '20052'
    print(extract_zip(example1))
    print(extract_zip(example2))
    print(extract_zip(example3))
    ```
- Note that 
    
    ```python
    end = len(s)
    ```
    gives us the index just past the last index.
- And 
    
    ```python
    start = len(s) - 5
    ```
    gives the index 5 position before the end.
- So, the <em>slice</em> becomes:
    
    ```python
    return s[start:end]
    ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.19

In `my_slicing3.py`, write a program that implements a function to extract the phone number in the same way as shown above, when the first part could be anything like "phone: 202-994-4000" or "my number is 202-994-4000".

**Submit your program `my_slicing3.py`.**
:::

:::{.callout-note}
<em>Slicing</em> has more to it than two numbers. We'll have more to say about this in Unit-2.
:::

<!-- ## 3.5 Using slicing to solve a problem
Suppose we want to determine the longest prefix that two strings have in common, as in:
```python
print(find_common_prefix('river', 'rivet'))
```
This should print 'rive' but
```python
print(find_common_prefix('river', 'stream'))
```
should find no common prefix.


**We will use the following ideas:**

- Let an index variable start at `0` and increase in a loop.
- For each value of the index, we'll compare the corresponding character in each string.
- When the characters are the same (or equal), we move to the next character and compare again.  
- The characters that are the same will be part of the common prefix.
- We keep moving to each and charater and compare them.
- The instance the characters are NOT equal, we would have gone past the end of the common prefix.

**Let's try the following program:**
```python
def find_common_prefix(w1, w2):
    for k in range(len(w1)):
        if w1[k] != w2[k]:
            break
    return w1[0:k]

print(find_common_prefix('river', 'rivet'))
```

**Let's point out that there is a reserved word <em>break</em> in the program above:**

- The reserved word <b>break</b> is used to, well, "break out" of a loop:
  
    ```python
    for k in range(len(w1)):
        if w1[k] != w2[k]:
            break
    ```
- When `break` statement is executed, the program exits the loop to the statement that follows the loop.
- Notice how we use slicing once we've found the char that's past the common prefix:
  
    ```python
    return w1[0:k]  # All the chars from 0 to k-1 inclusive
    ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.20
Type up the program below in `my_prefix.py`. 

```python
def find_common_prefix(w1, w2):
    for k in range(len(w1)):
        if w1[k] != w2[k]:
            break
    return w1[0:k]

print(find_common_prefix('river', 'rivet'))
```

**Submit your program `my_prefix.py`.**


**The following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

- Does the program `my_prefix.py` work as intended?

## 3.6 Built-in string functions in Python
Python comes with many useful functions for strings.

Here's a sample:
```python
A = ['to','infinity','and','beyond','and', 'even','further']
s = 'infinity'

# Convert to uppercase:
print(s.upper())       

# Count occurrences of the char 'i' in s:
print(s.count('i'))    

# Locate which index 'f' first occurs in s:
print(s.find('f'))     

# Occurrences of 'and' in list A:
print(A.count('and'))  

# Occurrences of 'i' in 2nd string in list A:
print(A[1].count('i')) 

if A[3].startswith('be'):
    print('starts with be')

data = '42'
print(data.isnumeric())
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.24
- Type up the above in `my_string_functions.py`.

- **Submit your program `my_string_functions.py`.**

**The following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

Examine the output to try and make sense of how the functions worked.
:::


**Explanation about how some of the string-functions work:**

- There's a key difference, for example, between the functions `len()` and `upper()`:
    
    ```python
    s = 'hello'
    k = len(s)
    t = s.upper()
    ```
    - The function
        `len()`
     is like the ones we've been writing ourselves.
    - In this case, the string s is given to it as a parameter:
    
    ```python
    k = len(s)
    ```
    - But the function `upper()` is quite different:
    
    ```python
    t = s.upper()
    ```
    - This is, in some sense, <em>attached</em> to the string variable s.
- The use of the period right after the variable followed by a function is a somewhat advanced topic:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.3/object-function.png)
We'll just <em>use</em> the feature.
- The advanced topic is called: <em>objects</em>.
  <br> (Yes. An ordinary name, but quite an involved topic, it turns out.)

**Let's emphasize one more feature with this snippet of code:**
```python
s = 'hello'
t = s.upper()
print(s)
print(t)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.25

Type up the above program in `my_string_functions2.py`. 

**Submit your program `my_string_functions2.py`.**
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- The string assigned to the variable `s` itself did not change but its uppercase version was returned by the call as shown below. 
    
    ```python
    t = s.upper()
    ```
- This returns a new string that gets placed into `t`.
:::

**Let's continue with the earlier example:**

- Similar "dot" functions are available for lists too, as in:
    
     ```python
    k = A.count('and')
    ```
    - This asks the list `A` to count how many times the string 'and' occurs in the list.
    - The number that is returned gets stored in `k`.
- Notice how we can call a "dot" like function in a string when the string itself is an element of a list:
    
    ```python
    k = A[1].count('i')
    ```
    - Here, `A[1]` is the second string in the list `A`.
    - This happens to be 'infinity'.
    - We're calling its `count()`function.
    - And giving that function the letter `'i'` to count.
    - It returns a number, which gets stored above in `k`.



**Consider the following partially completed code:**
```python
def get_zipcode(A):
    # Insert your code here

B = ['my','zip', 'is', '20052']
z = get_zipcode(B)
print(z+1)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.26

- Type the above code in `my_string_functions3.py`. 

- In `my_string_functions3.py`, note that the fourth string in the list `B` is a zipcode. 

- In `my_string_functions3.py`, complete the function above by replace the commented text so that the program returns a the zipcode as a number not a string i.e., the print statement outputs `20053`.

**Submit your program `my_string_functions3.py`.**

## 3.7 The concept of `type`
So far, we've seen different kinds of variables:

- **Integer variables are represented as shown below:**

    ```python
    a = 100
    b = 435
    ```
- **Floating-point variables for real numbers are represented as shown below:**

    ```python
    c = 3.14159
    d = 2.718
    ```
- **String variables are represented as shown below:**

    ```python
    e = 'hello'    # String with multiple chars
    f = 'h'        # Single-char string
    ```
- **Boolean variables are represented as shown below:**

    ```python
    g = False
    h = True
    ```
- **We've also seen other kinds of <em>features</em> or "things" in Python such as:**
    - Reserved words.
    - Expressions, whether arithmetic, comparison, or Boolean.
    - Lists.
    - Functions that we write using `def`.
    - Built-in functions like `len()`. and `print()`.
    - Control structures like `for` and `if` that direct the flow of execution.
    - Ways to use existing other code via `import`'s.

**Python programming language has other kinds of "things":**

- One of these is another kind of variable called a `complex` variable, for advanced math.
- Another kind of "thing" or feature is an <b>object</b> which is a kind of structure that can contain related variables and functions.
- Similarly, there are "things" called <b>generators</b> and <b>iterators</b> (an advanced topic)

**What we want to do here is focus your attention on a concept called <em>type</em>:**

- At any given moment, a variable is said to have a <b>type</b>.
- What doeas this mean?
- What kind of value does it have at the moment? An integer? A string?
- Consider the following lines of code:

    ```python
    x = 42      # The type of x is integer
    y = 4.2     # The type of y is floating point
    z = 'whoa'  # The type of z is string
    b = False   # The type of b is Boolean
    ```
- One can print the `type` of a variable as follows:
    
    ```python
    x = 42    
    y = 4.2   
    z = 'whoa'
    v = False 
    print(type(x), type(y), type(z), type(v))
    ```
- **The `type` information is often itself represention in a special Python feature called a <em>class</em> (intuitively, as in this "class of item").**

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.27

In `my_type.py`, type up the above program and find out what gets printed.

**Submit your program `my_type.py`.**
:::

Thus, we see that:

- A variable that holds `42` is rightfully an <b>integer variable</b>.
- A number like `4.2` is a floating-point number (what we've also called a real number), and so a variable that holds such a number is a <b>floating-point variable</b>.
- A string variable that holds `'whoa'` is just that, a <b>string variable</b>.
- And a variable that holds `True` or `False` is called a <b>Boolean variable</b>.

**Converting from one `type` to another:**

- It is often useful to go from one type to another.
- We've seen an example of going from single-char string to integer, and converting from int to string (and vice-versa).
- To review, let's look at a few more examples:
    
    ```python
    a = int(4.2)
    b = float(42)
    c = str(b)
    d = int('256')
    e = ord('z')
    f = chr(97)
    print(a, b, c, d, e, f)
    ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.28

Type the above in `my_type2.py`, to see how it works.

**Submit your program `my_type2.py`.**
:::

**Types and <em>operators</em>:**

- Because our keyboards are limited in the number of symbol keys, we need to use some symbols for multiple purposes.
- The way we see this is when one operator, like `+`, has different meanings when used with different types:
  
    ```python
    a = 3
    b = 4
    c = a + b         # + for arithmetic

    d = 'hello'
    e = 'world'
    f = d + ' ' + e   # + for string concatenation
    ```
- Rather than list all possible uses of all operator symbols, we will introduce additional uses beyond the common case wherever appropriate.
- Generally, you should be intentional about using operators: you should know what the purpose is.
- For example, consider:
  
    ```python
    a = 4
    b = a * 3
    print(b)          # prints 12

    d = 'hello'
    e = d * 3         # * for string concatenation
    print(e)          # Prints hellohellohello
    ```

<!-- ## 3.8 A text application
Sometimes we need to go beyond what Python has to offer.

**One way to do this is to find a popular <em>library</em> and use that:**

- **What's a <em>library</em>?**
- **A <em>library</em> is a collection of programs all related for a purpose.**
- For example, there's a **library called NLTK** (go look it up) that's aimed at processing English text:
    - It can figure out parts of speech from sentences.
    - It can pick out topics (somewhat approximately) in paragraphs.
    - It can group so-called stem-related words like "fry", "fries", "frying" and separate those from "friar".
- However, installing and learning to use these sophisticated packages requires some work.
- What we will do instead in this course is to provide you with simple programs that you can download and use directly without any installation.
- This is the purpose in providing programs like wordtool and drawtool.

**Let's use `wordtool` to find the longest sentence in a book:**
   
- The **`wordtool`** has a feature to break down text and give you one sentence at a time.
- For example:
    
    ```python
    import wordtool as wt

    sentences = wt.get_sentences_from_textfile('jabberwocky.txt')

    count = 0
        
    for s in sentences:
        count += 1
        print('Sentence #', count, ':\n', s, '\n', sep='')
    ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.29

- Type the above program in `my_sentence_app.py`, to see how it works. 

- You will need to download <a href="../../../media/useful/wordtool.py" download>**wordtool.py**</a>, <a href="../../../media/useful/wordsWithPOS.txt" download>**wordsWithPOS.txt**</a>, and the sample text file <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.3/jabberwocky.txt" download>**jabberwocky.txt**</a> all into your module folder. 

- You are likely to be familiar with the author's other famous works.

- **Submit your program `my_sentence_app.py`.**
:::

**Let's point out some salient feature in the program `my_sentence_app.py`:**

- When using functions in another program, one has to `import` that program:
- It is convenient to use a shorthand such as `wt` for an imported program `wordtool` as shown below:
    
    ```python
    import wordtool as wt
    ```
:::{.callout-note}
We could have called the shorthand for the imported program something other than `wt`.
:::


- The function `get_sentences_from_textfile` from `wt` can now be applied to a file to initiate the process of breaking down text and output one sentence at a time as shown below:
    
    ```python
    sentences = wt.get_sentences_from_textfile('jabberwocky.txt')
    ```
:::{.callout-note}
`wordtool` requires that you to name the file, expecting it to be a plain text file (not a Word-document file).   
:::


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.30
- Start with the program `my_sentence_app.py`, and save it as `my_sentence_app2.py`.

- Observe that the for-loop has `\n` and `sep=''` in its last line.

- Remove `\n` and `sep=''` from the line `print('Sentence #', count, ':\n', s, '\n', sep='')` in the program `my_sentence_app2.py`.

- Execute the program `my_sentence_app2.py` to make sure there are no errors and  observe the change in output (if any) by not including `\n` and `sep=''`. 

**Submit your program `my_sentence_app.py`.**
:::

**Let's now do something interesting with `wordtool` i.e., find the longest sentence (by length) in two texts and compare the two really long sentences.**
```python
import wordtool as wt

def get_longest_sentence(filename):
    sentences = wt.get_sentences_from_textfile(filename)
    maxL = 0
    
    for s in sentences:
        if len(s) > maxL:
            maxL = len(s)
            maxS = s

    return maxS


book = 'federalist_papers.txt'
s = get_longest_sentence(book)
print('Longest sentence in', book, 'with', len(s), 'chars:\n', s)

print()

book = 'darwin.txt'
s = get_longest_sentence(book)
print('Longest sentence in', book, 'with', len(s), 'chars:\n', s)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 3.31

- Type the above in `my_sentence_app3.py`. 

- Then download <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.3/darwin.txt" download>**darwin.txt**</a> (Darwin's <em>On the Origin of Species</em>) and <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.3/federalist_papers.txt" download>**federalist_papers.txt**</a>  (the Federalist Papers by Hamilton and others). 

- Execute the program `my_sentence_app3.py`.

- **Submit your program `my_sentence_app3.py`.**

**Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

- Which one has the longest? 
- Who wrote the longest sentence in the Federalist Papers? 
- Go to <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" download>Project Gutenberg</a> and find a text with a longer sentence.

```python
def is_odd(k):
    if k % 2 == 1:
        return true
    else:
        return false
```
- Identify and fix the error in `my_error1.py`.

- **Submit your `my_error1.py` after fixing the error.**
:::

### Exercise 3.34

```python
x = 4
if x >= 0 and <= 5:
    print('x is between 0 and 5 inclusive')
```
- Identify and fix the error in `my_error2.py`.

- **Submit your `my_error2.py` after fixing the error.**

## 0.7 A different version of print
Consider these two variations of using print:
```python
x = 2
s = 'eat'
y = 3.141

print('I love ' + str(x) + ' ' + s + ' ' + str(y))

print('I love', x, s, y)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 0.22

Type the above in `my_print_example.py` and submit it.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- The first version above uses string concatenation to send one big string to print:

    ```python
    print( 'I love ' + str(x) + ' ' + s + ' ' + str(y) )
    ```
- In the second version, the strings and variables given to print `(x, s, y)` are separated by commas.
- Here, print treats the four things as separate entities:

    ```python
    print('I love', x, s, y)
    ```
- And it, automatically inserts a space between the different things (that are separated by commas).
- Note that here, there is no need to convert numbers to strings.
