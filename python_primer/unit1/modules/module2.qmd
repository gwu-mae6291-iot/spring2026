## Objectives

By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Enhance your understanding of how to use def to write functions, then invoke them.
- Write code with function definitions and invocations.
- Write and debug code with functions
- Explore the different ways in which parameters work.
- Identify new syntactic elements related to the above.

<!-- ## 2.0 Wait, stop!
Before continuing it is essential to review functions as described in [**Module 2 of Unit-0**](../../unit0/modules/module2.qmd)

What to review most carefully:

- The notion of how execution starts outside a function, goes into a function, and comes back to where the function was invoked.

:::{.callout-tip}
When we come back to where the function was invoked, we continue execution just after the invocation.
:::


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.1

Please review [**Module 2 of Unit-0**](../../unit0/modules/module2.qmd).
There is nothing to submit in this exercise.
::: -->

## 2.1 A simple example
Consider this program:
```python
def increment_and_print(a):
    a = a + 1
    print(a)

i = 5
increment_and_print(i)

j = 6
increment_and_print(j)
```
:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.2

Type up the above in `my_func_example.py`.

Then do the following:

- Just before the line where the variable assignment `j = 6` is shown, print the value of i.
- Execute the program `my_func_example.py`.

Submit the program `my_func_example.py`.
:::

Let's explain:

- Let's start by distinguishing between a function <em>definition</em> (which merely tells Python what the function is about), and <em>invocation</em> (which asks Python to execute the function at that moment):
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/func-code.png)
- Now let's peer into what constitutes a definition:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/func-code2.png)
- In the above case, the function `increment_and_print` has only one parameter called `a`.
    - In the future, we'll see that a function can have several parameters, separated by commas.
    - For example

        ```python
        def increment_and_print(a, b, c):
        ```
- Next, let's examine how execution proceeds, starting with what happens when a function is invoked:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/func-code3.png)
- Once execution is inside the function:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/func-code4.png)
- Next, execution moves further into the second invocation:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/func-code5.png)
- The code inside the function now executes (again):
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/func-code6.png)

:::{.callout-note}
Did you notice that neither `i` nor `j` was affected by the incrementing of the value of variable `a`?

- This is because the value in `i` was copied into the newly-created variable `a` when the function was invoked.
- Even though variable `a` got incremented, that did not affect `i`.
:::
- Variables like `a` that appear in the parentheses of a function definition are called <em>parameters</em>.

What does a function <em>do</em> with its parameters?

- Think of the parameters as variables that can be used as regular variables for any purpose.
- For example, consider this program:
```python
def print_from_one_to(a):
    print('Printing between 1 and ', a)
    for i in range(1, a+1):
        print(i)

print_from_one_to(5)
print_from_one_to(6)
```
- Here, we used the parameter **`a`** in setting the upper limit of a for-loop.

:::{.callout-note}
- When a function is defined with a parameter, the intent is that some code <em>outside</em> the function will set the <em>value</em> of the parameter.

    - Thus, it would be allowed but technically defeat the purpose to write:
    
        ```python
        def print_from_one_to(a):
            a = 5
            print('Printing between 1 and ', a)
            for i in range(1, a+1):
                print(i)

        print_from_one_to(5)
        print_from_one_to(6)
        ```
    - Yes, this runs, but the whole point is for some other code to tell the function, "Hey, I'm going to set variable **`a`**, and <em>then</em> you do your printing with the value I set".
    - And so, when we write

        ```python
        def print_from_one_to(a):
            print('Printing between 1 and ', a)
            for i in range(1, a+1):
                print(i)
        print_from_one_to(5)   # We're telling the function that a = 5
        print_from_one_to(6)   # We're now telling the function to use a = 6
        ```
:::


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.3

Submit the following programs in this exercise:

1. `my_func_example2a.py`

:::



:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.5

In `my_func_example3.py`, fill in the code in the function below so that the output of the program is:
```python
*****
***
*
```
The partially-written program is as shown below.

```python
def print_stars(n):
    # Write your function code here

print_stars(5)
print_stars(3)
print_stars(1)
```

- Complete the above program by including your code under the comment (i.e., text followed by the #-symbol)
- You can include the comment in the your code.
- Execute the program `my_func_example3.py`.
- Submit your program `my_func_example3.py`.
:::


## 2.2 Multiple parameters

Remember Pythagoras? We know his famous result:

![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/pythagoras.png)

A <em>Pythagorean triple</em> is any group of three integers like <i>3,4,5</i> where the squares of the first two add up to the square of the third: <i>3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> = 5<sup>2</sup></i>.

We'll now write code to check whether a trio of numbers is indeed a Pythagorean triple:
```python
def check_pythagorean(a, b, c):
    if a*a + b*b == c*c:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')

check_pythagorean(3, 4, 5)
check_pythagorean(5, 12, 13)
check_pythagorean(6, 8, 20)
```

:::{.callout-note}
- This time, we've defined a <em>function</em> that takes three parameters:

    ```python
    def check_pythagorean(a, b, c):
        # The comments here are indented by a tab space. 
        # The function code replaces these comments as shown below.
    ```
- Notice the commas separating the three variables.
- Consider the first invocation:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/pytha-code.png)
- The invocation also uses commas to separate arguments.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.7

In `my_func_example4.py`, fill in the code in the function below so that the output of the program is:

```python
5
3
2
0
```

**Hint:** The idea is to compute the sum but only of the positive parameters; if neither value is positive, print `0`.

The partially written program is as shown below.

```python
def print_profit_total(a,b):
    # Write your function code here

print_profit_total(2, 3)
print_profit_total(-2, 3)
print_profit_total(2, -3)
print_profit_total(-2, -3)
```

- Complete the above program by including your code under the comment (i.e., text followed by the #-symbol)
- You can include the comment in the your code.
- Execute the program `my_func_example4.py`.
- Submit your program `my_func_example4.py`.
:::



## 2.3 Return values
So far, we've written methods that <em>take</em> values, do things and print.

We get a whole new level of programming power, when methods can compute something and <em>return</em> something to the invoking code.

Here's an example:
```python
def padd(a, b):
    total = 0
    if a >= 0:
        total += a
    if b >= 0:
        total += b
    return total

x = padd(-5, 6)
print(x)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.9

Type up the above in `my_func_example5.py`. 

**Try and answer the following for yourself:** What does the `padd()` function achieve by reviewing the program?

Then do the following: 

- First, execute the program `my_func_example5.py`. 
- Next, replace the function parameters with `5, -6`.
- Finally, replace the function parameters with `5, 6`. 

**Submit your program `my_func_example5.py` with function parameters `padd(5, 6)`.**
:::

Let's explain:

- First, execution begins after the function definition is "absorbed" by Python:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/return-code.png)  
- Remember, in an assignment statement, the right side is executed first:
    
    ```python
    x = padd(-5, 6)
    ```
The result of invoking this function somehow results in `x` getting a value stored inside it.
    <br> (We'll see how, shortly.)
- Next, execution goes into the function:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/return-code2.png)  

- When the return statement executes, the value returned (the value of `total` gets copied into `x`)
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/return-code3.png)
- One way to think about it is presented below:

    - Consider the following function invocation:

        ```python
        x = padd(-5, 6)
        ```
    - Then look at the function definition and the code block that is executed under **`def padd(a, b):`**.
    - After the function **`padd(-5, 6)`** is executed, it returns the value in one of its variables (i.e., **`total`**). 
    - In this case where the function is **`padd(-5, 6)`**, the value **`6`** is returned.
    <!-- - That, behind the scenes, replaces the function invocation: -->
    - The value **`6`** is now assigned to the the variable **`x`** as shown below.
    
        ```python
        x = 6
        ```
    - And thus, the value **`6`** gets copied into the variable **`x`**.



:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.10

In `my_func_example6.py`, complete the code in `sum_up_to()` so that it computes and then returns the sum of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive of 1 and n).
```python
def sum_up_to(n):
    # write your code here

result = sum_up_to(5)
print(result)            # should print 15
result = sum_up_to(10)
print(result)            # should print 55
```
:::



Let's return to our earlier example and use the `padd()` function in different ways:
```python
def padd(a, b):
    print('Received values: ', a, b)
    total = 0
    if a >= 0:
        total += a
    if b >= 0:
        total += b
    return total

print(padd(-5, 6))                   
x = padd(padd(-5,6), 7)              
print(x)                             
print(padd(padd(-5,6), padd(5,-6)))  
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.12

Type up the above in `my_func_example7.py`.

Then do the following:

- Execute the program `my_func_example7.py`.
- Submit the program `my_func_example7.py`.
:::

Let's examine each of the last four statements in the program `my_func_example7.py`:

- First, let us look at the following statement in the program `my_func_example7.py`:

    ```python
    print(padd(-5, 6))
    ```
    - In this case, the invocation of the function **`padd()`** occurs inside the **`print()`** statement.

    - The function **`padd(-5, 6)`** executes and returns the value **`6`**.

    - Then the **`print()`** statement is executed as shown below with the value **`6`**.
    
        ```python
        print( 6 )
        ```

    - The value **`6`** is the output of the **`print()`** function.

- Next, let us examine the following statement in the program `my_func_example7.py`: 
    
    ```python
    x = padd(padd(-5,6), 7)              
    ```

    - In this case,  the innermost **`padd()`** function is invoked first, i.e., **`padd(-5, 6)`** in 

        ```python
        x = padd( padd(-5,6), 7 )
        ```

    - The parameter values **`5` & `6`** are input into the function **`padd(-5, 6)`**.
    - The function **`padd(-5, 6)`** returns the value **`6`**, and the statement takes the form as shown below:

        ```python
        x = padd( 6, 7 )
        ```

    - Now the outermost **`padd()`** function has the value values **`6` & `7`** as its' parameters.
    - This results in another invocation to **`padd()`** with parameter values **`6` & `7`** i.e., **`padd( 6, 7 )`**.
    - The function **`padd( 6, 7 )`** is executed and it returns the value **`13`**.
    - The result is assigned to the variable **`x`** as shown below:
    
        ```python
        x = 13
        ```

- Finally, consider the last statement in the program `my_func_example7.py` as shown below:

    ```python
    print(padd(padd(-5,6), padd(5,-6)))  
    ```

    - In this case, there are two innermost invocations of the `padd()` functions. These are **`padd(-5, 6)` & `padd(5, -6)`** located inside the outermost `padd()` function as shown below:

        ```python
        print(padd( padd(-5,6), padd(5,-6) ))  
        ```

    - In the statement above the first function to be invoked is **`padd(-5, 6)`**. 

    - The function **`padd(-5, 6)`** returns the value **`6`** and the statement takes the following form: 

        ```python
        print(padd( 6, padd(5,-6) ))  
        ```

    - Next, the function **`padd(5, -6)`** is invoked
    
    - The function **`padd(5, -6)`** returns the value **`5`** and the statement takes the following form inside the **`print()`** statement: 
        
        ```python
        print(padd( 6, 5 ))  
        ```

    - Now, the values **`6 & 5`** become the parameters for the third invocation of the function **`padd()`**.
    
    - This invocation of the function **`padd( 6, 5 )`** returns the value **`11`** 
    
    - The **`print()`** statement is now executed with the returned output from the function **`padd( 6, 5 )`** as shown below: 

        ```python
        print( 11 )  
        ```
    - And so 11 gets sent to print, which prints it.
    - Whew!


## 2.4 Multiple returns in a function
Take a moment to go back up and quickly glance through the Pythagorean example.

Now consider this rewrite:
```python
def check_pythagorean(a, b, c):
    if a*a + b*b == c*c:
        print('In the if-part')
        return 'yes'
    else:
        print('In the else-part')
        return 'no'

result = check_pythagorean(3, 4, 5)
print(result)
result = check_pythagorean(5, 12, 13)
print(result)
result = check_pythagorean(6, 8, 20)
print(result)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.13

Type up the above in `my_func_example8.py`.

Execute the program `my_func_example8.py`.

Submit the program `my_func_example8.py`. 
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- When a function executes a return statement, execution exits the function right then and there, even if there's more code below.
- Thus for example, in the first time `check_pythagorean()` is invoked:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/return-code4.png)
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.14

Trying drawing a similar diagram for the other two function invocations in a separate document to help you understand the flow of the program. 

**There is nothing to submit in this exercise.**
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.15

In `my_func_example9.py`, complete the code below so that the function, when given three numbers, identifies the two larger ones and returns their sum.

```python
def add_bigger_pair(a, b, c):
    # Write your code here:

print(add_bigger_pair(2,3,4))  # Should print 7
print(add_bigger_pair(2,3,1))  # Should print 5
print(add_bigger_pair(2,1,4))  # Should print 6
```

- Complete the above program by including your code under the comment (i.e., text followed by the #-symbol)
- You can include the comment in the your code.
- Execute the program `my_func_example9.py`.
- Submit your program `my_func_example9.py`.
:::



## 2.5 Parameter and argument names
Consider this example:
```python
def subtract(a, b):
   c = b - a
   return c

x = 5
y = 6
z = subtract(x, y)
```

:::{.callout-note}
- We refer to `a` and `b` as <em>parameters</em> in the definition of the function:
    
    ```python
    def subtract(a, b):
    ```
- When function is invoked as shown below,

    ```python
    subtract(x, y):
    ```
we  use the term <em>function arguments</em> for `x` and `y`.
:::

The names given to parameters have <em>no relation</em> to the names used for arguments:

- In the above case:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/param-names.png)
- Consider this variation:
    
    ```python
    def subtract(a, b):
        c = b - a
        return c

    a = 5
    b = 6
    c = subtract(a, b)
    ```
- The a,b,c that are the parameter variables are <em>different</em> from the a,b,c variables below:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/param-names2.png)

:::{.callout-tip}
If you aren't sure, it's safest to use different names.
:::

## 2.6 What can you do with parameter variables?
Generally, the purpose of parameter variables is this:

- Consider this example:

    ```python
    def silly_func(a, b):
        c = 2*a - b
        print(c)

    silly_func(3, 4)
    x = 6
    silly_func(x, 8)
    ```
- From the point of view of the <em>definition of the function</em>, `silly_func(a, b)` thinks "Someone is going to put values into my variables `a` and `b`, and then I'll do stuff like calculate and print".

- From the point of view of code that is <em>using the function</em> or the invocation of the function, `silly_func(3, 4)` is saying "We'll set the function's parameter `a` to `3`, and `b` parameter to `4`, and then let the function do its thing". 

    ```python
    silly_func(3, 4)
    ```

    - Note that the values `3` and `4` are called the arguments of the invoked-function `silly_func(3, 4)`.

- Functions can use its parameter variables just like any other variable and <em>change its value</em>, as in:

    ```python
    def crazy_func(p, q):
        print(p)
        p = p + 3*q       # We're changing p here
        print(p)
        r = p + q
        print(r)

    x = 6
    y = 7
    crazy_func(x, y)
    ```
Because the value in `x` gets copied into the variable `p`, the value in `x` does not get changed even though the function changes the value in `p`.


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.17

Just by reading the above program, can you tell what the above program prints? 
The above question is for you understand the execution of the program and you don't need to submit a written answer. However, it is encouraged that you try it to fully-understand the execution of the above program and to confirm your result. 

**The following portion of the exercise is required for submission of this exercise:**

- Implement the above program in `my_func_example10.py`.

- Submit your program `my_func_example10.py`.
:::



## 2.10 Calling functions from functions
The code <em>inside</em> functions can be like regular code that's outside functions.

In particular, code inside functions can call (invoke) other functions.

For example:
```python
def increment(a):
    b = a + 1
    return b

def increment_twice(c):
    d = increment(c)
    e = increment(d)
    return e

x = 5
y = increment_twice(x)
print(y)
```

:::{.callout-note}
- The program starts execution at the line

    ```python
    x = 5
    ```
- Then, when `increment_twice(x)` is called, we enter the function `increment_twice()` with the variable `c` set to 5 (copied from x).
- The next line in there
    
    ```python
    d = increment(c)
    ```
    results in a call to `increment()` with the value 5 copied into parameter `a`.
- Then, the code in `increment()`  executes, resulting in 6 being returned.
- The returned value 6 is stored in `d`.
- Then `increment()` is called again with the value in `d`. (now 6) copied into `a`.
- The code in `increment()` executes resulting in 7 returned.
- Execution continues in the `increment_twice()` function and the value 7 is stored in `e`.
- Finally `increment_twice()`completes execution and returns the value in `e`, which is 7.
- This value is stored in `y`,
- Execution continues from there to the print.
:::

In addition, observe the following:

- We can shorten the above code by writing:

    ```python
    def increment(a):
        return a + 1

    def increment_twice(c):
        return increment(increment(c))

    x = 5
    y = increment_twice(x)
    print(y)
    ```
- Notice that one can return the result of an <em>expression</em>:

    ```python
    return a + 1
    ```
    In this case, the calculation is an arithmetic expression.
- One can also have the result of a function call itself be returned:
    
    ```python
    def increment_twice(c):
        return increment(increment(c))
    ```
- After, it's possible to do this:
    
    ```python
    print( increment(increment(c)) )
    ```
    Here, the result of the inner `increment()`call
    
    ```python
    print( increment(increment(c)) )
    ```
    is sent again to `increment()`:

    ```python
    print( increment( ... ) )
    ```
- In the same vein, we can, instead of printing, execute a return:
    
    ```python
    return increment(increment(c))
    ```

:::{.callout-tip}
You do NOT have to use such shortcuts. Some shortcuts are an advanced topic and may in fact make your code harder to read, and harder to fix mistakes in.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.33

Consider the following program:
```python
def decrement(a):
    return a - 1

def subtract(a, b):
    for i in range(0, a):
        b = decrement(b)
    return b

print(subtract(5, 9))
print(subtract(3, 13))
```

- Type up the above in `my_subtraction.py`. 
- Execute the program `my_subtraction.py` and examine the output. 
- Submit your program `my_subtraction.py`.


**Recommended but not required for submission in this exercise:** As with other tracing exercises this is also optional and in this particular case a bit long, but worth doing because it will help your understanding. Try tracing the execution step-by-step in a separate document.

<!-- ## 2.11 More stats via programming
Armed with our new ability to work with functions and lists, we will see how easy it is to compute basic statistics with data.

Before we get to that, here's a small exercise.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.35

Consider the following program:
```python
def find_smallest(A):
    smallest = A[0]
    for k in A:
        if k < smallest:
            smallest = k
    return smallest

data = [-2.3, -1.22, 1.6, -10.5, 1.4, 2.5, -3.32, 11.03, 2, 2, -1.4]
print(find_smallest(data))
```

- Type up the above in `my_find_smallest.py`. 
- Execute the program `my_find_smallest.py` and examine the output. 
- Submit your program `my_find_smallest.py`.

**Recommended but not required for submission in this exercise:** It's critical to understand how the variable `smallest` is changing through the loop, and why the function `find_smallest()` does in fact identify the smallest value in a list. Remember: the more negative a number, the smaller. Thus, -10 is less than or "smaller" than -4.
:::

With that, consider this partially complete program:
```python
def find_smallest(A):
    smallest = A[0]
    for k in A:
        if k < smallest:
            smallest = k
    return smallest

def find_largest(A):
    # Insert your code here:

def find_span(A):
    smallest = find_smallest(A)
    largest = find_largest(A)
    span = largest - smallest
    return span

data = [-2.3, -1.22, 1.6, -10.5, 1.4, 2.5, -3.32, 11.03, 2, 2, -1.4]
print('span: ', find_span(data))
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.36

In `my_stats.py` complete the above so that the <em>span</em> of the data is computed and printed. This is the difference between the largest and smallest values.

- Type up the above in `my_stats.py`.
- Execute the program `my_stats.py` and examine the output to check if the <em>span</em> of the data is computed and printed. 
- Submit your program `my_stats.py`.
:::



Next, let's write some (partially complete) code for standard statistics:
```python
import math

def compute_mean(A):
    # Insert your code here:

def compute_std(A):
    mean = compute_mean(A)
    total = 0
    for k in A:
        total += (k-mean)**2
    std = math.sqrt( total / len(A) )
    return std

data = [-2.3, -1.22, 1.6, -10.5, 1.4, 2.5, -3.32, 11.03, 2, 2, -1.4]
print('mean =', compute_mean(data))
print('standard deviation =', compute_std(data))
```

:::{.callout-note}
- The <em>mean</em> of a list of numbers is the total (add the numbers up) divided by "how many numbers there are" in the list.
- The <em>standard deviation</em> is more involved:
    - Consider data like:

        ```python
        10, 20, 30, 40, 50
        ```
    This is centered around 30 (mean in this case).
    - Here, a different set of data that's also centered around 30:
        
        ```python
        28, 29, 30, 31, 32
        ```
    - Clearly, the second set of data is very bunched up around 30 while the first is more spread out.
    - The <em>standard deviation</em> is a measure (a single number) that rates the "spreadout-ness" of data.
    - The more spread out, the higher the standard deviation.
    - To calculate it, we take the difference of each data from the mean, square it (to make it always positive), then add all of these up.
    - This gives something called the <em>variance</em>, which itself is a fine measure of spreadout-ness.
    - However, because we're adding up squared numbers, the variance can become a big number.
    - To bring the measure closer to the "level" of the actual data, we take the square root of the variance: this is the <em>standard deviation</em>.

- If you've never seen this before, it's worth computing by hand with the data above, just so you understand how it looks on paper. Then compare with the results from the program.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.38

- Complete the code above and type it up in `my_stats2.py`.
- Execute the program `my_stats2.py` and examine the output to check if the <em>mean</em> and <em>standard deviation</em> of the data are computed and printed. 
- You should get as output as shown below:

    ```python
    mean = 0.1627272727272727
    standard deviation = 4.955716792313685
    ```
    (Real numbers, what can you do?)

- Submit your program `my_stats2.py`.

:::

Next, let's tackle the more challenging problem of identifying <em>outliers</em>:

- Take a closer look at the data:

    ```python
    data = [-2.3, -1.22, 1.6, -10.5, 1.4, 2.5, -3.32, 11.03, 2, 2, -1.4]
    ```
    
- We see that two data values **`-10.5`** & **`11.03`** seem to be far outside the range of the other data.

- Suppose we use the following approach to identifying outliers:
    - Compute the mean and standard deviation.
    - Identify those data that lie further than two standard deviations away from the mean.
    - Call these <em>outliers</em>.

:::{.callout-note}
The traditional definition uses <em>three</em> standard deviations, but we'll stick with two because it makes our example easy to work with.
:::

Let's write a function to do this:
```python
def find_outliers(A):
    mean = compute_mean(A)
    std = compute_std(A)
    for k in A:
        if k < (mean - 2*std):
            print('Found outlier: ', k)
        elif k > (mean + 2*std):
            print('Found outlier: ', k)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.39

- In `my_stats2.py`, add the above to your code and save your program as `my_stats3.py`.

- Execute the program `my_stats3.py` and examine the output to check if the <em>mean</em>, <em>standard deviation</em> and <em>outliers</em> of the data are computed and printed.

-  The output of your program should be as shown below:

    ```python
    mean = 0.1627272727272727
    standard deviation = 4.955716792313685
    Found outlier:  -10.5
    Found outlier:  11.03
    ```
- Submit your program `my_stats3.py`.

## 2.12 A function that calls itself
**This is a somewhat advanced topic (not on any exam or assignment!).**

We will only present a simple example only so that you see what it's like.

Consider the following example:

```python
def factorial(n):
    # print(n)
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        m = factorial(n-1)
        return n * m

print(factorial(5))
print(factorial(10))
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.40

- Type up the above in `my_factorial.py`. 

- Remove the `#` symbol to allow `print(n)` statement to return the value of `n`. 

- Execute the program `my_factorial.py`. 

- Submit your program `my_factorial.py`. 

**Recommended but not required for submission in this exercise:** Try tracing through what happens when `factorial(5)` is called.
:::

Let's point out:

- Yes, it's allowed for a function to call itself.
- Such a function is called a <em>recursive function</em>, and the resulting behavior is called <em>recursion</em>.
- The above example computes numbers like
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    1 &times; 2 &times; 3 &times; 4 &times; 5 &times; = 120
    <br>
    (This ascending multiplication is called factorial.)
- For recursion to work, the successive calls to itself have to end so that we don't get the infinity of barbershop mirrors.
- In the above case, n eventually becomes 1. In this case, there's no further call to itself.
- Recursion is hard to understand, and will be featured in later courses after you've got more programming under your belt.
- Surprisingly, many problems are solvable elegantly and efficiently using recursion.
- It is possible to do recursion improperly, in which case a program is set up to recurse forever. In this case, Python will give up after too many recursions.



## 2.13 Inscribed geometric figures as art
Of course we're going to try and use functions and drawing.

Consider this program:
```python
import math
from drawtool import DrawTool

dt = DrawTool()
dt.set_XY_range(-1,1, -1,1)
dt.set_aspect('equal')

def draw_circle_in_square(side):
    radius = side/2
    dt.set_color('r')
    dt.draw_circle(0,0, radius)
    return radius

def draw_square_in_circle(radius):
    side = math.sqrt(2) * radius
    dt.set_color('b')
    dt.draw_rectangle(-side/2, -side/2, side, side)
    return side

side = 1
dt.draw_rectangle(-side/2, -side/2, side, side)

n = 5
for i in range(n):
    radius = draw_circle_in_square(side)
    side = draw_square_in_circle(radius)

dt.display()
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.42

Download <a href="../../../media/useful/drawtool.py" download>**drawtool.py**</a> and <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/circle_square.py" download>**circle_square.py**</a> and run the latter to get
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.2/kepler.png)

Then do the following:

- Change n to `n = 20` in the program `circle_square.py`. 
- Execute the program `circle_square.py`. 
- Submit your program `circle_square.py` along with `drawtool.py`. 

**Recommended but not required for submission in this exercise:** Perhaps experiment with colors. Try to read the functions and figure out, not so much the calculation, as what they're doing.
:::

At first, this looks like a simple exercise in geometric art, or a depiction of the "evil eye" but there's more to it:

- Notice the construction:
    - We start with a square.
    - Then we <em>inscribe</em> the biggest possible circle that'll fit inside that square.
    - Now we find the biggest possible square that'll fit inside the recently drawn circle.
    - Then the square inscribed in <em>that circle</em>, and so on.
- Instead of just using circles and squares, one can use a square first, then a pentagon, then a hexagon, and so on.
- The result is something that Kepler worked on a long time ago. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%E2%80%93Bouwkamp_constant">**this article**</a>
- The historical significance is this:
    - Ever since the Greeks, polygons and circles have held special significance.
    - So, something like this had an almost religious significance.
    - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler">**Kepler**</a> then used a similar idea for solids to expound (an entirely wrong) theory of planetary motion.
    - To his credit, he realized he was wrong when shown higher quality data (from Tycho Brahe), and used the data to fit ellipses.
    - This was the beginning of the modern understanding of planetary motion, later mathematically solved by Isaac Newton.

## 2.14 When things go wrong
In each of the exercises below, first try to identify the error just by reading. Then type up the program to confirm, and after that, fix the error.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.43

```python
def square_it(x):
    y = x * x

a = 5
b = square_it(a)
print(b)
```
Identify and fix the error in `my_error1.py`.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.44

```python
def bigger(x,y)
    if x > y:
        return x
    else:
        return y

print(bigger(4,5))
```
Identify and fix the error in `my_error2.py`.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 2.45

```python
def find_smallest(A):
    smallest = 1000
    for k in A:
        if k < smallest:
            smallest = k
    return smallest

B = [2, 1, 4, 3]
print(find_smallest(B))
```
Does the above program work? What is the reasoning behind the line `smallest = 1000`? What would go wrong if you removed it altogether? Can you create a list (change the data in B) which will cause the function to fail to find the smallest number. Fix the issue in `my_error3.py`.
