## Objectives
By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Evaluate Boolean (pronounced: <em>BOO-lee-unn</em>) expressions.
- Construct Boolean expressions from English descriptions.
- Mentally execute (trace) code with <em>conditionals</em>, that is,  if, if-else, and if-multi-else statements.
- Write and debug code with conditionals.
- Write and debug code with conditionals inside loops.
- Identify new syntactic elements related to the above.

## 1.0 A simple example
Consider this program:
```python
x = 5
y = 4

if x > y:
    print('Hey, x is bigger')

print("OK, we're done")
```
:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.1

In `my_ifexample.py`, type up the above and examine the output. 
Then, do the following:

1. Below the print with `Hey, x is bigger`, add another print-statement to print another line of text. For example, you could add a line such as, 'Hey, y is smaller'. Make sure the new print-statement is indented (i.e., it should have 4 spaces preceding it).
2. Run the program and make sure you are getting the outputs you programmed.
3. Now change the value of y to 6 and see for yourself if you are getting a different output.
4. Submit `my_ifexample.py` with the modifications outlined in point #1 and #3.
:::

Let's explain:

- First, observe:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code.png)
- Now, at the moment the if-statement executes, the condition is evaluated:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code2.png)
If the condition is true, then the code that's indented below the if-statement executes.
- Consider what happens when y is 6:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code3.png)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.2

Consider this program:

```python
s = 0
for i in range(6):
    s = s + i
    if s < 15:
        print('Less than 15')

print('Done')
```
Type up the above program in `my_ifexample2.py` and submit it.

The following part of the exercise is not required for submission. However, it is important for you to complete it on your own to understand the execution of the program `my_ifexample2.py`. 

- Trace through the program above using a table in a spreadsheet or a document
    - Track the variables i and s, as well as the print-statements to confirm the output of the program.
:::

## 1.1 if-else
Think of <em>else</em> as <em>if</em>'s occasional partner.

Consider this example:
```python
x = 5
y = 4

if x > y:
    print('Hey, x is bigger')
else:
    print('Who said x is bigger?')
    print('In fact, y is bigger')

print("OK, we're done")
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.3

Type up the above in `my_ifexample3.py` and examine the output. 
Then do the following:

1. Change the value of y to 6 and examine the output. 
2. Submit the program with `y = 6`.
:::

Let's point out:

- When x is indeed larger than y, the code in the if-body executes:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code4.png)
- When the if-condition evaluates to false:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code5.png)
- What happens when x is 5 and y is 5?
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code6.png)

Because some of these arrows might be difficult to follow, let's emphasize some blocks (lines) of code:

- First consider when x is larger than y:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code4-alt.png)
- And when y is larger than x:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code5-alt.png)

## 1.2 if-elif-else
Consider this variation:
```python
x = 5
y = 5

if x > y:
    print('Hey, x is bigger')
elif y > x:
    print('Who said x is bigger?')
    print('In fact, y is bigger')
else:
    print('Actually, they are equal')

print("OK, we're done")
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.4

Type up the above in `my_ifexample4.py` and examine the output. 
Then do the following:

1. Change the variable assigments to x = 6 and y = 4, and run the program to examine the output.
2. Change the variable assigments to x = 4 and y = 6, and run the program to examine the output.
3. Change the variable assigments to  x = 5 and y = 5, and run the program to examine the output.
4. Submit the program `my_ifexample4.py` with x = 5 and y = 5.
:::

Let's explain:

- First, consider the case wehere x=5 and y=5:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code7.png)
- Now consider the case where x=5 and y=4:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code8.png)
- Next: x=5, y=6:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code9.png)

One can have as many elif sections as one would like, for example:
```python
x = 3

if x == 1:
    print('one')
elif x == 2:
    print('two')
elif x == 3:
    print('three')
elif x == 4:
    print('four')
else:
    print('big')
```

Think of the whole thing as a giant if-statement:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code10.png)
In the above case, when x is 3, the execution path through the giant if-statement is:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code11.png)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.5

Type up the above in `my_ifexample5.py` and examine the output. 
Then do the following: 

1. Notice that, in the first line, the variable x is assigned the value 3.  
2. Run the program again after changing the variable assigment in the first line of the program to x = 1, x = 2, x = 4, and x = 5 and examine the output each time.
3. Submit the program `my_ifexample5.py` with x = 3. 

The following part of the exercise is not required for submission. However, it will help you understand how the elif-construct works
 
 - Draw execution pathways (similar to the picture above) for each case in a separate document.
:::

Consider this program:
```python
x = 5
y = 4
z = 3

if x > y:
    print('Hey, x is bigger')

if x > z:
    print('x is bigger than z')
    print('So, x must be the largest')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.6

Type up the above in `my_ifexample6.py` and run the program to examine the output. Then do the following: 

1. Change the variable assigment of y to 6, and run the program to examine the output.
2. Change the variable assigment of y to 4, and submit the program, `my_ifexample6.py`.

<!-- Then try to alter the program without changing the print-statements so that it works in all cases for possible values of x,y, and z. That is, whichever of the above print-statements gets printed correctly reflects the values of x, y and z. -->
:::



## 1.3 Nested conditionals
Consider this program:
```python
a = 3
b = 4
c = 5

if a < b:
    if a < c:
        print('a is the smallest')
    else:
        print('a is not the smallest')

print('Done')
```

This is an example of a nested conditional (nested if):

- First, examine the indented structure:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code12.png)
- The flow of execution:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/if-code13.png)

Consider this variation:
```python
a = 3
b = 4
c = 5

if a < b:
    if a < c:
        print('a is the smallest')
    else:
        print('a is not the smallest')
    print('We know a is less than b')
else:
    print('We know a is not less than b')

print('Done')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.8

Type up the above in `my_nestedif.py` and examine the output. 
Then do the following: 

1. Run the program for a = 3, b = 4, c = 5 and examine the output.
2. Run the program for a = 3, b = 4, c = 2 and examine the output.
3. Run the program for a = 6, b = 4, c = 5 and examine the output.
4. Submit the program for a = 3, b = 4 and c = 5. 

The following part of the exercise is not required for submission. However, it will help you understand how the nested if-construct works.
 
- Draw the flow of execution for the following three cases: (1) when a=3, b=4, c=5; (2) when a=3, b=4, c=2; (3) when a=6, b=4, c=5 in a separate document.
:::

<!-- :::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.9

In `my_smallest_of_three.py`, modify the above program so that it prints out, appropriately, one of "a is the smallest", "b is the smallest" or "c is the smallest", depending on the actual values of a, b, and c. Try different values of these variables to make sure your program is working correctly.
::: -->

:::{.callout-tip}
- A numeric variable can be strictly less than, less than or equal to, strictly greater than, greater than or equal to, or equal to another variable.
- Accordingly, the different types of less/greater comparisons are:

    ```python
    a < b      # Strictly less (a=3, b=4)
    a <= b     # Could be less (a=3, b=5), could be equal (a=3, b=3) 
    a > b      # Strictly greater (a=3, b=2)
    a >= b     # Could be greater (a=3, b=1), could be equal (a=2, b=2) 
    ```
:::

## 1.4 Combining conditions
Consider this program:
```python
x = 5
y = 5
z = 5

if x == y and y == z:
    print('All three are equal')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.10

Type up the above in `my_boolean.py`. 
Then do the following: 

1. Run the program for x=3, y=4, z=5 and examine the output.
1. Run the program for x=3, y=3, z=3 and examine the output.
3. Run the program for x=4, y=4, z=4 and examine the output.
4. Submit the program with the modifications outlined in point #3. 
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- The first thing to point out is the `==` operator:
    - Because we've been using the <em>equals</em> operator (=) for <em>assigning values to variables</em>, we need something else to test for <em>equality</em>.
    - The equality operator in Python is `==`, as in:
    
        ```python
        if x == y and y == z:
        ```
    - Alas, the problems with limited keyboard symbols!
- **Important:** The difference between = and == is very important to remember. It's easy to make a mistake.
    - The if-statement combines two conditions using the <em>Boolean operator</em> **and**:
    
    ```python
    if x == y and y == z:
    ```
<!--     - The combining occurs with the <em>Boolean operator</em> <b>and</b>:
    
    ```python
    if x == y and y == z:
    ``` -->
    - We can clarify the parts and combination thereof using parentheses:
    
    ```python
    if (x == y) and (y == z):
    ```
    - The two conditions  are often called <em>clauses</em>:
<!--         - The first clause is `(x == y)`.
    
        ```python
        if (x == y) and (y == z):
        ```
        - The second clause is `(y == z)`.
    
        ```python
        if (x == y) and (y == z):
        ``` -->
        - You could also include many more clauses.

- Boolean is pronounced "BOO lee unn".

- A Boolean operator takes expressions and evaluates to either `True` or `False`.        

- The "and" operator works like this:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/boolean1.png)

:::

Let's go back to finding the smallest of three numbers using conditionals:
```python
a = 3
b = 4
c = 5

# Fill in code here ... 
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.11

In `my_smallest_of_three2.py`, fill in code to identify which of the three variables has the smallest value, depending on the actual values of a, b, and c. Use if-statements with multiple clauses. 

- Try different values of these variables to verify that your program is working correctly.

- There is nothing to submit for this exercise.
:::



The counterpart to the <b>and</b> operator is the <b>or</b> operator: 
```python
a = -2.718

if (a <= 0) or (a >= 1):
    print('a is not between 0 and 1')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.13

Type up the above in `my_boolean2.py`. 
Then:

1. Change the value of the variable `a` to 0.5 and run the program to examine the output.
2. Submit the program with the modification outlined in point #1.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- We have shown how to write "less than or equal to" using `<=`    
<!-- - So, now we can add "equals" and "not equals" to the numeric comparisons: -->
    
    ```python
    a < b      # Strictly less than
    a <= b     # Could be less, could be equal
    a > b      # Strictly greater than
    a >= b     # Could be greater, could be equal 
    a == b     # Exactly equal
    a != b     # Not equal
    ```
- For the <b>or</b> operator to evaluate to `True`, <em>any one or both of the two expressions need to be true</em>.
- Consider:

    ```python
    a = 3
    b = 4
    if (a < 10) or (b < 10):
        print('One or both of them is less than 10')
    ```
    - In this case both will evaluate to `True`, so the print statement executes.
    - Suppose we make `a = 3` and `b = 11`, the print statement will execute.
    - Suppose we make `a = 11`, `b = 3`, the print statement will execute.
    - But, if `a = 11` and `b = 12`, the <b>or</b> fails (i.e., both clauses are false), and the print won't execute.
- Incidentally, let's replace <b>or</b> with <b>and</b> in the above case and see what we get:
    
    ```python
    a = 3
    b = 4
    if (a < 10) and (b < 10):
        print('Both of them are less than 10')
    ```
In this case, both sub-conditions are satisfied, meaning the whole if-condition is satisfied and the print will execute.
- But if we had the following:
    
    ```python
    a = 3
    b = 4
    if (a < 10) and (b > 10):
        print('One or both of them is less than 10')
    ```
In this case, the second comparison would fail, and the print wouldn't occur.

- Whereas if we had <b>or</b>:
    
    ```python
    a = 3
    b = 4
    if (a > 10) or (b < 10):
        print('One or both of them is less than 10')
    ```
Here, it's enough that a is less than 3, so the print executes even though "b greater than 10" fails.
:::

Next, let's look at the NOT operator (written as !):
```python
x = 5
y = 6
z = 7

if (x != y) and (x != z):
    print('x is different from y and from z')
```  

Here, read `!=` as "not equals".

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.14

Type up the above in `my_boolean3.py`. 
Then do the following: 

1. Change the value of `z` value to 6 (same as y) and observe the output.
2. Submit the program with the modification outlined in point #1.
:::

One can combine any number of <b>and</b>'s. For example,
```python
x = 5
y = 6
z = 7

if (x != y) and (x != z) and (y != z):
    print('x, y, z are all different')
```
The difference between `!=` and `not`
    
- We should read `!=` as "not equals", just as we read `==` as "equals".
- There is another operator called <b>not</b> which applies to Boolean expressions, as we'll see next.

The <b>not</b> operator

- One can apply the <b>not</b> operator to groups of clauses using additional parentheses:

    ```python
    x = 8

    if not ( (x == 5) or (x == 6) ):
        print('x is neither 5 nor 6')
    ```
- Here, <b>not</b> is asking that whatever it applies to be inverted.
- Thus, consider the expression
    
    ```python
    if not ((x == 5) or (x == 6)):
    ```
- In this case, x is 8. So, neither of `(x == 5)` nor `(x == 6)` is true.
- Thus, the whole expression `( (x == 5) or (x ==6) )` is false.
- Which means `not ( (x == 5) or (x ==6) )` evaluates to true.
- Therefore, the print executes.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.15

Suppose integer variables `a,b,c,d,e` have values a=1, b=1, c=3, d=4, e=5. Consider the following three expressions:

```python
( (a <= b) and (c+d > e) and (d > 1) )

( (a > c) or ( (c+1 < e) and (c-b > a) ) )

not ( (b == d-c) and (a > b) or (c < d) )
```
- Try to evaluate each expression by hand. 

- Then, write up a program `my_boolean4.py` with variables assignments, a=1, b=1, c=3, d=4 and e=5, to evaluate the above expressions. 
    - Use print-statements with each of the expressions to see the results. 

- Submit `my_boolean4.py`. 

- The following part is not required for submission: 
    - Compare the results of your evaluation-by-hand with those of the program.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.16

In `my_boolean5.py`, write a program that begins with the following program shown below.

```python
a = -3
b = -4
diff = abs(a-b) 
# Note: abs() is a Python built-in function that returns 
# the absolute value of the specified number
print(diff)
```
**Note: `abs()` is a Python built-in function that returns the absolute value of the specified number**

**Case-1:** 
Use conditionals to print out the absolute difference between the two numbers if they are greater than or equal to 1.

<!-- Use conditionals to print out the absolute difference between the two numbers. In the above case, the difference is 1.  -->

- Hint: Use logic operator, >= to print the variable diff . Use the code structure shown below that compares a <variable>  to a value in order to print.

    ```python
    if <variable> >= value:
        print(<variable>) 
    ```

**Case-2:** Use a=3, b=4, the difference is also 1. 

**Case-3:** When a=-3, b=4, the difference is 7.

Submit `my_boolean5.py` with `a = -3` and `b = -4`.
:::



## 1.5 Conditionals and loops
Let's write a program to loop through integers and print only  the even numbers:
```python
n = 10
for i in range(1, n+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, 'is even')
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.18
Type up the above program in `my_oddeven.py`and run it to examine the output. Then do the following: 

1.  Modify the above program so that for every number between n and 1 (inclusive), the program prints whether it's even or odd in reverse order, as in:
    
    ```python
    10 is even
    9 is odd
    8 is even
    7 is odd
    6 is even
    5 is odd
    4 is even
    3 is odd
    2 is even
    1 is odd
    ```
2. Submit the program with modification outlined in point #1. 

3. The following part of the exercise is not required for submission: 

    - Trace through the interactions in the above program in a separate spreadsheet or document.
:::

<!-- ## 1.8 Some stats via programming
Let's now apply our practice with conditionals to solve some problems in probability and statistics. 

For example: Suppose I toss a coin 4 times and observe the face that's up. What is the probability that I get all "tails" (i.e., not one toss shows "heads").

Let's do this in steps.

First, let's write a program to toss a coin 4 times
```python
import random

coin = ['heads', 'tails']
for i in range(4):
    toss = random.choice(coin)
    print(toss)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.28

Type up the above in `my_cointosses.py` and run it a few times to see what you get.

Submit your program.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- We have made a list of strings:
    
    ```python
    coin = ['heads', 'tails']
    ```
- Python has a useful way to randomly select an element in a list:

    ```python
    toss = random.choice(coin)
    ```
- Alternatively, we could have written:

    ```python
    toss = random.choice(['heads','tails'])
    ```
and avoided defining `coin`.
:::

Next, instead of printing the results, let's count the number of heads observed:
```python
import random

count = 0
for i in range(4):
    toss = random.choice(['heads', 'tails'])
    if toss == 'heads':
        count = count + 1

print('Number of heads', count)
```


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.29

Type up the above in `my_cointosses2.py` and run it a few times to see what you get.

Submit your program.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
Observe how the string that's randomly selected from the list is compared against 'heads':
```python
if toss == 'heads':
    count = count + 1
```
:::

Next, what we need to do is repeat the 4-coin toss many times:

- Suppose we call 4-coin tosses a single <em>trial</em>.
- If we ran a single trial and obtained 1 heads (count=1), could we conclude that the probability of getting all-4-tails is zero?
- What we need to do is run a large number of trials and record how many of them result in 4-tails.
- We'll use the term "success" to identify a trial in which we get all 4-tails.
- Let's examine the code:
```python
import random

trials = 10
successes = 0
for i in range(trials):
    # Count number of heads in 4 tosses:
    count = 0
    for i in range(4):
        toss = random.choice(['heads', 'tails'])
        if toss == 'heads':
            count = count + 1

    # If the count is zero, that's a success
    if count == 0:
        successes += 1

# Ratio of successes to trials:
probability = successes / trials
print('probability =', probability)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.30

Type up the above in `my_cointosses3.py` and run it a few times to see what you get. 
Then do the following: 

1. Increase the number of trials to 10000 and examine the output. 
Note: The theoretical answer is 0.0625 (approximately a 6% chance that there's no heads in 4 tosses).
2. Submit your program with modification outlined in point #1.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.31

Use the same program `my_cointosses3.py` as a starting point and write up a program `my_cointosses4.py` to run 10000 trials in the following experiment: 

- Toss a coin 10 times and record a success if you get an equal number of heads and tails.

- Hint: To accomplish this, you have to change the parameter in the `range()` function in the nested-for-loop.
:::

Now let's solve a problem with the other favorite manner of generating chance: dice

We'll roll two dice and add the numbers that are face up. We want to ask: what are the chances we get sum of 7 (when added up)?

Here's the program:
```python
import random

possible_outcomes = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
trials = 100000
successes = 0
for i in range(trials):
    roll1 = random.choice(possible_outcomes)
    roll2 = random.choice(possible_outcomes)
    if roll1 + roll2 == 7:
        successes += 1

probability = successes / trials
print('probability =', probability)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 1.33

Type up the above in `my_dice.py` and examine the output. 
Then do the following and examine the probability in each output: 

- Run the program for the sum of the values of the dice being 12, i.e., roll1 + roll2 = 12
- Run the program for the sum of the values of the dice being 2, i.e., roll1 + roll2 = 2 
- Submit your program for roll1 + roll2 = 7

Let's also look at how one can use Python to randomly generate real numbers, for example:
```python
import random

trials = 100
total = 0

for i in range(trials):
    x = random.uniform(5, 10)
    print(x)
    total += x

print('mean =', total/trials)
```

:::{.callout-note}
- By using 

    ```python
    x = random.uniform(5, 10)
    ```
we can generate a random real number between 5 and 10.

- In the above program we are generating many such numbers and calculating their average.

### Exercise 1.34

Type up the above in `my_uniform.py` and examine the average. 
Then perform the following two modifications:

**Case-1:** Increase the number of trials, to `trials = 1000`, and examine the average.

**Case-2:** For 1000 trials, generate numbers between 25 and 30 and examine the average

**Submit your program with modifications outlined in Case-2**

Before you head off to Vegas with your Python programs, let's point out:

- You can use programming to explore ideas in probability and statistics, as well as to solve real problems.
- It is an exciting way to learn statistics that we will have more to say about later.

## 1.9 Algorithmic art
Let's now use what we've learned to explore the notion of how computers can be programmed to generate abstract art.

In our first example, we'll draw lines from one border of a square to another:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/artwork.png)

Let's describe the main idea via some pseudocode:

- In a loop we'll generate:

    ```python
    Set up an initial x1,y1 and x2,y2
    for i in ...
        Pick a random color
        Draw a line from x1,y1, y2,y2
        Make the current endpoint the start of the next line:
        x1 = x2
        y1 = y2
        Pick a random border
        Now pick a new random point on the next border
    ```
- When we pick a border, we'll need to figure out the coordinates.

### Exercise 1.35

Download <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1/conditional_art.py" download>**conditional_art.py**</a> and <a href="../../../media/useful/drawtool.py" download>**drawtool.py**</a>. Then do the following:

1. Try it out and then examine the code to confirm that it mirrors the pseudocode. 

2. Try another value of n, i.e., n = 1000. You should get an image like the one below.

![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1/Conditional_art1_2.png)

3. Change the options for your randomly chosen colors. Use `colors = ['c','m','y','k']` and the value of n = 1000.

4. Submit your program with the modifcations suggested in point #3.

Next, we'll explore an interesting question:

- Think of random art as one end of a spectrum.
- And highly-structured geometry as generated by an algorithm at the other end.
- The question: can we adjust a "knob" that will let us generate a mix? And is that more aesthetic?

### Exercise 1.36

Download <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1/conditional_art2.py" download>**conditional_art2.py**</a>. Run the program and then do the following: 

**Case-1:** Change the value of the `structure` parameter, (between 0 and 1). For example, change 0.9 to 0.1. 

**Case-2:** Assign the `structure` parameter a value 0.5 and change the value of n to 100.  

**Submit your program with the modifications outlined in Case-2**

### Exercise 1.37

```python
x = 5
y = 6
if x < y
    print('x is less than y')
```
Identify and fix the error in `my_error1.py`.

### Exercise 1.38

```python
x = 6
y = 5
if x !< y:
    print('x is not less than y')
```
Identify and fix the error in `my_error2.py`.

### Exercise 1.40

```python
a = 2.5

# See whether a lies between 0 to 1, or 1 to 2, 
# or something else
if (a > 0) and (a < 1):
    print('between 0 and 1')
else if (a > 1) and (a < 2):
    print('between 1 and 2')
else:
    print('something else')
```
Identify and fix the error in `my_error3.py`.
