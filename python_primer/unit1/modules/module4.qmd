## Objectives
By the end of this module you will be able to:

- Work through examples of indefinite loops.
- Write while-loop versions of for-loops.
- Work through examples of using the `break` statement.
- Write code to read and write to text files.

## 4.0 `while` loops: An example
The numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on are <em>squares</em>, with the next one being 36 (which is 6<sup>2</sup>).

**Suppose our goal is to identify the largest square that's less than 1000.**

We'll first show how this can be solved with a new kind of loop: the <em>while-loop</em>, and then try the same problem with a <em>for-loop</em>.

The program:
```python
k = 1
while k*k < 1000:
    k = k + 1

# Reduce by 1 because now k*k > 1000
k = k - 1

print('largest square < 1000:', k*k, '= square of', k)
```

### Exercise 4.1

Type up the above in `my_while_example.py`.

Submit your progam `my_while_example.py`.
:::

How does a while-loop work?

- The essential idea is: a while-loop keeps iterating until its <em>condition</em> evaluates to False.
- Let's examine the structure:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/while-code.png)
- In our example, the condition was:
  ```python
  while k*k < 1000:
  ```
  Thus, as long as the value of `k` is such that `k*k` is less than 1000, execution enters and stays inside the loop.
- Notice that `k` is incremented (or changed) <em>inside</em> the loop:
  ```python
  while k*k < 1000:
      k = k + 1
  ```
- Thus, eventually `k`will get large enough so that `k*k` will be larger than 1000.
- When k is 32, in fact, 32*32 = 1024, which will cause the condition `k*k < 1000`to evaluate to False.
- At this moment, execution exits the loop to the whatever code follows:
  ![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/while-code2.png)

**Let's now examine a simpler while-loop:**
```python
k = 1
while k < 6:
  print(k)
  k = k + 1
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.2

**Confirm by typing up the above in `my_while_example2.py`.**

- **Submit your program `my_while_example2.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

  - Trace the execution of each iteration and develop your understanding of how the while-loop is executed.

:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.3

Consider the following <em>while-loop</em>:
```python
k = 7
while k < 6:
  print(k)
  k = k + 1
```
- **Type up the above in `my_while_example3.py`.**

- **Submit your program `my_while_example3.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

  - Trace the execution of each iteration and develop your understanding of how the while-loop is executed.



:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.4

Consider this variation:
```python
k = 1
while k < 6:
  print(k)
```
- **Type up the above in `my_while_example4.py`.**

- **When you execute this program**,  you may need to terminate the execution of the program by hand (by getting rid of the window itself).

- **Submit your program `my_while_example4.py`.** 

  - After a minute, you may need to terminate the execution of the program by pressing the keys `Control` & `C` on your keyboard or closing the IDE completely.

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

  - Trace the execution of each iteration and develop your understanding of how the while-loop is executed.
:::

**Keep in mind while you examine the example discussed below:**

- **A while-loop typically must feature some kind of <em>initialization before the loop</em> as shown below:**
  ```python
  k = 1
  while k < 6:
    print(k)
    k = k + 1
  ```
- **The variable that's involved in the condition should be changed inside the loop so that the condition eventually evaluates to `False`:**
  ```python
  k = 1
  while k < 6:
    print(k)
    k = k + 1
  ```

- **Another important thing to remember:** If you forget to change a variable like `k` inside the loop, the condition will never becomes `False`, which means the loop will iterate forever:
  ```python
  k = 1
  while k < 6:
    print(k)
    i = k + 1   # Error!
  ```
**In the example discussed above**

    - The incremented value `k+1` does not get stored in `k`.
    - Which means `k` never gets large enough.
    - Therefore `k` &lt; `6` will always be True.
    - Thus, we get an <em>infinite loop</em> (that iterates forever).    

  - It's alright, but probably not useful, if the condition never evaluates to `True` even once:
    
    ```python
    k = 6
    while k < 6:
      print(k)
      k = k + 1
    ```
  - The code still runs but the while-loop is not executed at all.

## 4.1 `while` loops: an example with floating point variables 
Consider the following example:
```python
x = 0.5
s = 0
while s <= 2:
  s = s + x

print('s =', s)
  ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.5

**Try to guess the output before confirming in `my_while_example5.py`.**

- **Type up the above in `my_while_example5.py`.**

- **Submit your program `my_while_example5.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

  - Trace the execution of each iteration and develop your understanding of how the while-loop is executed.

:::

:::{.callout-note}
- The value of x (which is 0.5) keeps getting added to s, as long as s is less <em>or equal</em> to 2.
- Thus, the last value of s to keep going in the loop is when s = 2.
- At this time, we stay for one more iteration, after which s becomes 2.5.
:::

**Let's look at a more illustrative version now:**
```python
x = 0.5
s = 0
k = 0
while s <= 2:
  s = s + x
  k = k + 1

print('s =', s, 'k =', k)
```

Here, we've added a <em>counter</em> variable to track each
loop iteration.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.6
- **Type up the above in `my_while_example6.py`.**

- **Submit your program `my_while_example6.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

  - Trace the execution of each iteration and develop your understanding of how the while-loop is executed.
:::

**So far it's been straightforward. Let's now solve a problem:**

- **Remember [**Zeno's paradox**](../../unit0/modules/module6.qmd#zeno)?**
- To summarize one version, Zeno said (with a wry smile, probably):

  - To walk a mile, you'd have to first walk half the remaining distance (0.5 miles).
  - Then, to get to the rest, you'd have to walk at least half of the remaining (0.25).
  - Then, half of the remainder (0.125)
  - ... and so on.
  - So, the total distance would be an infinite sum: 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ...
  - Which is infinite [he said]
- **Let's count <em>how many</em> successive halvings add up to, say, 0.9.**
- **Examine the code shown below:**
  ```python
  x = 1
  s = 0
  k = 0
  while s < 0.9:
    x = x / 2   # Halve x each time
    s = s + x
    k = k +1

  print(k)
  ```

  - We accumulate the sum in `s`.
  - Note that we start with `x = 1` because we perform the halving <em>before</em> adding to `s`.
  - This means the first value added into `s` is `0.5` (as intended).
  - Each such addition into `s` get counted in `k`.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.7
- **Type up the above in `my_while_example7.py`.**

- **Submit your program `my_while_example7.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

  - Trace the execution of the three variables and develop your understanding of how the while-loop is executed in `my_while_example7.py`.
:::

**A few comments that go beyond the scope of the course (just for curiosity):**

- The infinite sum, in fact, adds up to 1.
- It took centuries for mathematics to develop to a point where one can prove that infinite sums are acceptable and can have finite results.
- However, a computer can only represent real numbers approximately, which means the sum is itself approximate.
- You can see this by changing the while-condition from
  ```python
  while s < 0.9:
  ```
  to 
  ```python
  while s < 1:
  ```
- Theoretical math would say that the <em>while-loop</em> would execute forever, but because there limits to what's representable on a computer, the loop will indeed terminate.

## 4.2 for vs. while
Let's contrast for-loops and while-loops by writing a for-loop as a while-loop, and vice-versa.

As an example, let's print the numbers 0 through 10:
```python
# for-loop version
for k in range(11):
  print(k)

# while-loop version
k = 0
while k < 11:
  print(k)
  k = k + 1
```

:::{.callout-note}
- **The <em>for-loop</em> is simpler to write.**

- **The <em>while-loop</em> must make explicit three things:**

  - The initialization:
    ```python
    k = 0 # --> initialization
    while k < 11:
      print(k)
      k = k + 1
    ```
  - The termination condition:
    ```python
    k = 0
    while k < 11: # --> condition
      print(k)
      k = k + 1
    ```
  - And the variable change (that will ultimately cause the condition to become False):
    ```python
    k = 0
    while k < 11:
      print(k)
      k = k + 1 # --> variable change
    ```
- All of this is hidden in the <em>for-loop</em>.
- Underneath the hood, it turns out, the <em>for-loop</em> also has these three elements. 
- It's just that <em>we</em> don't have to write them, Python does so behind the scenes.
- When you write <em>while-loop</em>, ask yourself: "Do I have the three elements (initialization, condition, variable-change)?"
- **A really common mistake:**
  ```python
  k = 0
  while k < 11:
    print(k)
  ```
  **This loop runs forever!**
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.10

**Consider the following <em>for-loop</em>:**
```python
for k in range(5, 20, 2):
  print(k)
```
- **In `my_for_while.py`, write the while-loop equivalent.**

- **Submit your program, `my_for_while.py`.**


:::

Next, let's go from `while` to `for`:

- Consider this while-loop that prints the letters in a string backwards:
  ```python
  s = 'hello'
  k = len(s) - 1
  while k >= 0:
    print(s[k])
    k = k - 1
  ```

:::{.callout-note}
- The initialization starts k at the last index of the string:
  ```python
  k = len(s) - 1
  ```
- The loop condition expects k to decrement until it hits 0.
- After this, k (when it's -1) will have gone past the left end of the string.
- k decrements in the loop.
:::

- The equivalent for-loop is efficient to write, but less pretty:
  ```python
  for k in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):
    print(s[k])
  ```
Here:

  - The range begins with 
    ```python
    for k in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):
    ```
  - Ends with 0, but has the index just past (-1) as the limit:
    ```python
    for k in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):
    ```
  - And the increment is -1 (which makes it a decrement).


- Later, when we learn more advanced ways of using slicing, we will be able to do the same thing with shorter code.

### Exercise 4.11
- **Type up the above program involving the <em>for-loop</em> and <em>while-loop</em>  in the same program,  `my_for_while2.py`.**

- **Submit your program `my_for_while2.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

  - Trace the execution of both the <em>for-loop</em> and <em>while-loop</em> and develop your understanding of how the loops are executed in `my_for_while2.py`.
:::


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.12

**Consider the following program with a <em>while-loop</em>:**
```python
def func(A):
  k = 0
  while A[k].startswith('h') and (len(A[k]) > 4) and (k < len(A)):
    print(A[k])
    k += 1

def func2(A):
  # Write your for-equivalent here:

B = ['hello', 'hey there', 'howdy', 'huzzah', 'hi', 'greetings']
func(B)
func2(B)
```
- **Complete the above program with the missing <em>for-loop</em> and save it as `my_for_while3.py`.**

- **Submit your program `my_for_while3.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

  - Trace the execution of both the <em>for-loop</em> and <em>while-loop</em> and develop your understanding of how the loops are executed in `my_for_while3.py`.
    - You may consider tracing the <em>while-loop</em>loop (in `func`), to see that the loop keeps printing strings from a list as long as the strings start with `h` and have length at least `5`. 
    - Then, trace the code in `func2` involving the <em>for-loop</em> to achieve the same result in your program, `my_for_while3.py`.
:::





## 4.3 Using `break` in loops
**Let's return to our first example of finding the last square that's less than 1000.**

Recall what we wrote:
```python
k = 1
while k*k < 1000:
  k = k + 1

k = k - 1
print('largest square < 1000:', k*k, '= square of', k)
```

**One can use a `break` statement as an alternative to writing the "loop exit" condition as the while condition.**

- We'll first do this with a <em>for-loop</em>, and then see something unusual with the <em>while-loop</em> version.

- To simplify tracing, let's rephrase to "largest square less than 50".

First, the for-loop version:
```python
for k in range(1, 50):
  # print('Before-if: k =', k)
  if k*k > 50:
      break
  # print('After-if: k =', k)

k = k - 1
print(k)
```


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.14

- **Type up the above in `my_break.py`, removing the # to un-comment the print-statements so that you can see exactly what happens when the if-condition triggers.**

- **Submit your program `my_break.py`.**
:::


**Let's point out some salient features of the `break`-statement:**

- A `break`-statement is the reserved word `break` all by itself on a line, as seen above.
- When a `break`-statement is executed, Python looks for the loop that encloses the `break` and abruptly, right there and then, exits the loop.
- The `break`-statements are useful to check for conditions that should result in leaving the loop immediately.
- One could write code like this, but it would make no sense:
  ```python
  for k in range(10):
    print(k)
    break
  ```
  This would cause the first value (0) to print, and a break right out of the loop.
- As a mathematical aside, we know that we don't really need the <em>for-loop</em> range to be as high as `50`:
  ```python
  for k in range(1, 50):
    if k*k > 50:
        break
  ```
  After all, as `k` gets close to `50`, there is no way k*k would be less than `50`. However, we'll leave it as is, for the sake of simplicity.
- There are options in writing the loop. Consider the following case:
  ```python
  for k in range(1, 50):
    if (k+1)*(k+1) > 50:
      print(k)
      break
  ```
  Is this more elegant, if a bit harder to understand at first?

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.15
- **Type up the above program in `my_break2.py`.**

- **Submit your program `my_break2.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 

  - Trace the execution of the above program and develop your understanding of how the <em>for-loop</em> and `break` statements are executed in `my_break2.py`.
:::

**Next, let's look at a <em>while-loop</em> version of the program:**

- Here's the code:
  ```python
  k = 1
  while True:
    if k*k > 50:
      break
    k = k + 1

  k = k - 1
  print(k)
  ```
- Observe:
  ![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/while-code3.png)

- Was it surprising that we deliberately set up a loop to appear to run forever?
- This is entirely do-able and often desirable, <em>provided</em> we are real careful to set up a condition <em>inside</em> the loop to break out eventually.
- We need to be sure we hit that condition eventually.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.16
- **This exercise is to help you develop an understanding of what can go wrong with <em>while-loop</em> execution in the above program.**  

  - Try and understand for yourself what would go wrong if the statement `k = k + 1` was mistakenly typed in as  `k = k - 1`.

- **There is nothing to submit in this exercise.**
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.17
- **In Exercise 4.17, go back to the earlier Exercise 4.12 where you wrote a `while` loop to print strings of length at least 5, and starting with 'h'.**
- **Rewrite the while-loop implementing a `break`-statement instead.**
  - Make a modification in Ex 4.12 to the function `func(A)` that has a `while` loop implementation.
  - The modification should print just the first word from the list `B` that starts with an 'h'
- **Save your program as `my_break3.py` and submit it.**
<!-- Answering the following is to develop an understanding of what can go wrong with <em>while-loop</em> execution in the above program.**
In `my_break3.py`, go back to the earlier exercise (4.12) where you wrote a while-loop to print strings of length at least 5, and starting with 'h'. Rewrite the while-loop to use a break-statement instead. -->
:::

## 4.4 Loops within loops
Just as we've seen nested for-loops, so can we have nested while-loops or one kind inside another.

Consider this example:
```python
m = 10
while m <= 10000:
  for k in range(1, m):
    if (k+1)*(k+1) >= m:
      print('largest square <', m, ':',k*k)
      break
  m = m * 10
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.19
- **Type up the above program in `my_nested_loop.py` .**

- **Submit your program `my_nested_loop.py` .**
<!-- Type the above in `my_nested_loop.py` and try to make sense of it. -->
:::

Let's explain:

- First, notice that we have a for-loop inside a while-loop:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/while-code4.png)
- Let's start with understanding what happens in the outer loop:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/while-code5.png)
- Thus, m is first 10, then 100, then 1000, then 10000.
- Now let's see what happens within one iteration of the outerloop (for a particular value of m):
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/while-code6.png)

:::{.callout-tip}
The `break`-statement in the <em>for-loop</em> exits the <em>for-loop</em> (the enclosing loop), which means we'll still be inside the <em>while-loop</em> (where `m` changes).
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.20

- **Start with the program `my_nested_loop.py` from Exercise 4.19 and change the inner loop to a `while` loop so that we get the same output.**

- **Save your program as `my_nested_loop2.py` and submit it.**

:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.21
- **This exercise is to help you develop an understanding of the complexity in programs invovling loops.**  
  - In `my_nested_loop3.py` earlier, change the code so that both the outer-loop and inner-loop are for-loops. 
  - One way to solve this problem: 
    - Use a variable called `j` to range through the outer <em>for-loop</em> and then ensure that the inner-loop executes only when `j` happens to equal `m`. (Aren't you glad we have <em>while-loops</em> ?)

- **There is nothing to submit in this exercise.**
:::

<!-- ## 4.5 More stats via programming
**Consider the following problem:** 

- An experiment consists of flipping three coins.
- The experiment is repeated until all three are "heads"
- On average, how many experiments are needed until all three turn up "heads"?

**One way to think about this problem "statistically" is as described below:**

- Suppose we hire a thousand people to each perform repeated three-coin flips.
- For very few of these people, they'll get "heads-heads-heads" the very first experiment.
- For others, they might have to repeat 10 times before they see this.
- Each person counts how many experiments had to be tried before getting three-heads.
- The result is the average number across the thousand people: the <em>average</em> number of three-coin flips needed to see three heads.

**Instead of calculating by hand, we will write a program to estimate this number:**
```python
import random

num_trials = 1000
total = 0

for k in range(num_trials):
  got_three = False
  num_three_flips = 0
  while not got_three:
    c1 = random.choice(['H','T'])
    c2 = random.choice(['H','T'])
    c3 = random.choice(['H','T'])
    num_three_flips += 1
    if (c1 == 'H') and (c2 == 'H') and (c3 == 'H'):
      got_three = True
  total += num_three_flips

estimate = total / num_trials
print('estimate', estimate)
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.23

- **Type up the above in `my_coin_flips.py` to get an estimate.**
- **Submit the program `my_coin_flips.py` with 1000 trials.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 
  - Increase the number of trials to 10000 get a more accurate estimate.
  -  Can you explain the result intuitively?
:::

**Let's try and understand the execution of the above program:**

- First, let's point out the process of estimation (the outer loop) that we'd use in any estimation problem:
  ```python
  num_trials = 1000
  total = 0

  for k in range(num_trials):
    # how many of these resulted in successes?

  estimate = total / num_trials
  ```
- Now let's look inside to see how each trial is performed:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/while-code7.png)
- A variable like `got_three` is sometimes called a <em>flag variable</em>: we use it to flag a condition that we're looking for.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.24
- **Start with the program `my_coin_flips.py` from Exercise 4.23 and instead of using a <em>flag variable</em>, use a `break`-statement to exit the loop.**
  - You might have to make a small adjustment to get the correct result.

- **Save your program as `my_coin_flips2.py` abd submit it.**
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.25

**In this exercise, consider an experiment where you roll a die twice to see if you get `6` and `6`.** 

- **In `my_dierolls.py`, estimate the average number of experiments needed to get two sixes.**
- **Submit your program, `my_dierolls.py`.** 
::: -->

## 4.6 New topic: reading from a file
**Very often, data is collected and stored in files, and so it's desirable to learn how write code that plucks data right out of such files.**

**Let's start with a simple test file of plain text.**

- First, examine the file <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/testfile.txt" download>**testfile.txt**</a> to see that it's a file consisting of four lines of text. (From the poet Ogden Nash.)


**We will look at a few different versions of reading from this file.**

- Here's the first example:

  ```python
  with open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:
    lines = in_file.read()

  print(type(lines))
  print(lines)
  ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.27

- **Type up the above program in `my_file_read.py`.**
- **Submit your program, `my_file_read.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 
  - What is the type of the variable `lines`?
:::


:::{.callout-note}
- We've used two Python reserved words:
  ```python
  with open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:
  ```
- Although file input/output (I/O) does not strictly require the `with` structure, it is useful because:
  - Files that are being accessed by one program are said to be in an "opened" state.
  - For another program to be able access the file, the first one has to "close" it (that is, signal that it's done with the file).
  - The `with` structure automatically takes care of it.
- The function call to `open`takes the name of the file and the kind of access, for example:
  ```python
  with open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:
  ```
  - 'r' for read-only access (we're not changing the file here)
  - 'w' for write, if we should choose to.
- The result of opening a file is to get a special kind of variable, what we've called `in_file` in this case:
  ```python
  with open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:
  ```
- It is this variable that's going to perform the reading and, in this case, get us all the text in one shot:
  ```python
  with open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:
    lines = in_file.read()
  ```
- Note that all the lines are returned as a <em>single string</em>.
- This means, it will be difficult to analyze string-by-string, if that's our goal.
- There is a way to take the single string and break it into separate lines, but let's instead find a way to read separate lines.
:::


Accordingly, let's look at a way to read the file into a <em>list of strings</em>, where each line is one string in the list:
```python
lines = []
with open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:
  line = in_file.readline()
  while line != '':
    lines.append(line.strip())
    line = in_file.readline()

print(type(lines))
print(lines)
```

### Exercise 4.28

- **Type up the above program in `my_file_read2.py`.**
- **Submit your program, `my_file_read2.py`.**

- **Answering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:** 
  - What is the type of the variable `lines`?
:::

:::{.callout-note}
- Here, we're reading one line at a time and appending to a running list, which is the `lines` variable.
- The problem is, for any general file, we won't know in advance <em>how many</em> lines of text are in the file.
- A <em>while-loop</em> to the rescue!
- Thus, we keep reading from the file as long as a read operation produces a line:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/while-code8.png)
:::

**We will now look at how to write to a file.**

- Suppose we've read a text file into a list of strings.
- Let's now write these to a new file:
  ```python
  with open('testcopy.txt', 'w') as out_file:
    for line in lines:
      out_file.write(line + '\n')
  ```
- This time, we're opening a file called `testcopy.txt` for the purpose of writing to it:
  ```python
  with open('testcopy.txt', 'w') as out_file:
    for line in lines:
      out_file.write(line + '\n')
  ```
- We've named our file variable `out_file`.
- That will let us use a function called `write()`:
  ```python
  with open('testcopy.txt', 'w') as out_file:
    for line in lines:
      out_file.write(line + '\n')
  ```
  Here, we're looping through the list, writing each string as one line in the file.
- Notice that we need to insert the '\n' at the end of each line.
   <br> Recall:
  - '`\n`' represents an instruction to both output and files to "go to the next line right now".
  - Thus for example
    ```python
    print('hello' + 'world')           # Prints helloworld on one line
    print('hello' + '\n' + 'world')    # Prints hello, and then world on the next line
    ```
    - So, to write strings to different lines, we have to tell the function that writes to files to go to the next line with an explicit '\n'.
    - It's similar with reading, if we read a whole file as one string, that string will contain the so-called <em>linebreaks</em> (the '\n' characters).


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.29

- **In `my_file_readwrite.py`, combine the reading and writing so that the program as whole results in copying from <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/testfile.txt" download>testfile.txt</a> to `testcopy.txt`.**

- **Submit your program, `my_file_readwrite.py`.**
:::

**Next, let's read from a file of numbers and perform some basic stats:**

- First, examine the file <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/data.txt" download>**data.txt**</a> and see that it's a collection of numbers, one per line.
- We'll read line by line as a string, and then convert to a floating-point number:
  ```python
  data = []
  with open('data.txt', 'r') as in_file:
    line = in_file.readline()
    while line != '':
      s = line.strip()           # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
      x = float(s)               # Convert string to float
      data.append(x)             # Add to our list
      line = in_file.readline()  # Get the next line

  print(data)
  ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.30

- **Type up the above program in `my_file_data.py`**. 
- **Add code to compute the average of the numbers and print the average.** 
  - **Compute the total as you iterate in the <em>while-loop</em>.**
  - **The program should print the average of the data and the data as shown below**
    
    ```python
    5.485714285714287
    [5.0, 1.3, 6.77, 12.3, 2.01, 3.14, 7.88]
    ```
:::

<!-- ## 4.7 Extracting multiple data from each line
**Consider a data file that looks like this, with three numbers on each line:**
```python
6.0 6.0 9.0
4 6 8  
24 16 2  
3 3.0 3
0.1 0.5 0.3
```

- **What we'd like to do is compute the average of the numbers in each line. So, the output should be something like:**
  
  ```python
  Average of 6.0 6.0 9.0 is: 7.0
  Average of 4.0 6.0 8.0 is: 6.0
  Average of 24.0 16.0 2.0 is: 14.0
  Average of 3.0 3.0 3.0 is: 3.0
  Average of 0.1 0.5 0.3 is: 0.3
  ```

- **Therefore, what need to do is not only read a line at a time, but be able to extract multiple items <em>from within a line</em>.**


- **We can <em>split</em> a string as follows:**
  
- **Consider the following example:**
  ```python
  s = '6.0 6.0 9.0'
  data = s.split()    # data is a list
  print(data)        
  ```

  - Here, the `split()` function in strings, looks for whitespace within and separates out into a list those items separated by this whitespace.
  - So, in the above example, we'll have the string `6.0 6.0 9.0` split into a list of three strings `['6.0', '6.0', '9.0']`
  - Having a list of strings is not enough to compute the average of the <em>numbers</em> in those strings.
  - We need to convert into numbers:
  
    ```python
    s = '6.0 6.0 9.0'
    data = s.split()    # data is a list
    print(data)    
    x = float(data[0])
    y = float(data[1])
    z = float(data[2])  # x, y, z are numbers  
    avg = (x + y + z) / 3.0
    print(avg)
    ```
  
  - We can now read one line at a time from the data file, split each line, convert to numbers, and then calculate the average for each line.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.32

- **Type up the above program in `my_split_example.py`**. 

- **Submit your program`my_split_example.py`**. 

:::

**We'll now tackle one additional complication:**

- **Download and examine the file <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/data2.txt" download>data2.txt**</a> in a text editor.
  - Identify all the (unnecessary) whitespace within.
- It is common for real data to be acquired or presented with mistakes, missing entries, or weird whitespacing.
- The missing entry problem is somewhat harder to tackle, so we'll postpone that for another time.
- But we can easily eliminate whitespace using `strip()`.
- For example consider:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/datafile.png)
- Thus, we need to worry about when a line is all whitespace but not empty.
- Let's put these ideas into code:
  ```python
  with open('data2.txt','r') as in_file:
    line = in_file.readline()
    while line != None:
      line = line.strip()
      print('[', line, ']', sep='')
      if len(line) == 0:
        break
      data = line.split()
      print(data)
      x = float(data[0])
      y = float(data[1])
      z = float(data[2])
      avg = (x + y + z) / 3.0
      print('Average of ', x, ' ', y, ' ', z, ' is: ', avg, sep='')
      line = in_file.readline()
  ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.33

- **Type up the above in `my_file_data2.py`.** 
  - You should have already downloaded the file <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/data2.txt" download>**data2.txt**</a>  in the same folder.

- **Submit your program `my_file_data2.py`.** 
:::


**We'll point out a few things as shown below:**
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/avg-code.png)

- We have two print's in there to see what we get as a result of `strip()` and `split()`:
  ```python
  line = line.strip()
  print('[', line, ']', sep='')

  data = line.split()
  print(data)
  ```
- Recall: the `sep=''` (empty separation) parameter tells `print()` not to add its own whitespace between different arguments.

- Notice also that we have deliberately added in our printing,a pair of brackets:
  ```python 
  print('[', line, ']', sep='')
  ```
  - This is a common programming technique when you want to identify whitespace: put something around it that is actually visible.
- You also noticed that `split()` produces a `list`, and that each string in the list has already had whitespace removed on either side.

## 4.8 While-loops when files are large
**Let's return to a problem we've seen before i.e., identifying the longest sentence in a text file.**

**Take a moment to <a href="https://gwu-csci1012.github.io/units/unit1/modules/module3.html#a-text-application"> review that section</a>**

**Let's understand the following from the review:**
  
- To find the longest sentence, we read the whole file into one giant list of sentences.
- Then, we went through the list, recording the longest sentence.
- For a really large text file, the list could be too long to fit into memory.
- Let's use a different version that reads sentence-by-sentence:
  ```python
  import wordtool as wt

  def get_longest_sentence(filename):
    # Initiate the reading of the file
    sentences = wt.open_file_bysentence(filename)
    maxL = 0

    # Get first sentence
    s = wt.next_sentence()
    while s != None:
      if len(s) > maxL:       # Possibly update maxS
        maxL = len(s)
        maxS = s
      s = wt.next_sentence()  # next one

    return maxS


  book = 'federalist_papers.txt'
  s = get_longest_sentence(book)
  print('Longest sentence in', book, 'with', len(s), 'chars:\n', s)
  ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.34
- You will need to download the following files for this exercise:
  1. <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/federalist_papers.txt" download>**federalist_papers.txt**</a>
  2. <a href="../../../media/useful/wordtool.py" download>**wordtool.py**</a> and 
  3. <a href="../../../media/useful/wordsWithPOS.txt" download>**wordsWithPOS.txt**</a>.
- **Type up the above in `my_text_analysis.py`.** 
  - The program`my_text_analysis.py`, counts the number of sentences that have length greater than 280 characters (more than a tweet) in <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/federalist_papers.txt" download>**federalist_papers.txt**</a>. 
  - It will print the longest sentence with the number of characters in it.
- **Submit your program `my_text_analysis.py`.** 
:::

## 4.9 Random walks and art

But of course, we're somehow going to combine while-loops with our recurring themes (algorithmic art, randomness).

This time, **we will use a well-known idea from science called a <em>random walk</em>:**

- Imagine standing at the origin:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/randomwalk.png)
- Then, we choose a random <em>direction</em> from among: North, South, East, West.
- Once such a direction is randomly chosen and we take a fixed-size step in that direction, and mark the spot:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/randomwalk2.png)
- Here's what it might look like after 5 steps:
![](../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/randomwalk3.png)
- Here's the program:
  ```python
  import random
  from drawtool import DrawTool

  dt = DrawTool()
  dt.set_XY_range(-5,5, -5,5)
  dt.set_aspect('equal')

  step = 1

  def do_walk(max_steps):
    x = 0
    y = 0
    num_steps = 0
    dt.draw_point(x, y)
    while num_steps < max_steps:
      direction = random.choice(['N','S','W','E'])
      if direction == 'N':
        y += step
      elif direction == 'S':
        y -= step
      elif direction == 'E':
        x += step
      else:
        x -= step
      dt.draw_point(x, y)
      print(direction, x, y)
      num_steps += 1

  do_walk(5)

  dt.display()
  ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.35

- You will need to download <a href="../../../media/useful/drawtool.py" download>**drawtool.py**</a>. for this exercise.

- **Type up the above program in `my_randomwalk.py`.** 

- **Submit your program `my_randomwalk.py`.** 

**Recommended but not required for submission in this exercise:**

- Try out a larger number of steps i.e., change the argument in function `do_walk(5)` to `do_walk(10)` and `do_walk(100)`. 
- Change the draw color using `dt.set_color('r')`.
- Call `do_walk()` again following `dt.set_color('r')`.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
- The submission requires only the program `my_randomwalk.py` that when executed will generate the expected graphs as described in the problem.
- **You are not required submit any graphs generated by the program.**   
:::

**Instead of running the random walk for a fixed number of steps, we'll now run the random walk until it "hits" one of the sides and stop.**

- To do this, we'll use the approach of:
  ```python
  while True:
      # get a random direction and move
      # if we hit one of the sides, then break
  ```
- We'll also enlarge the box to be bigger and make the step size smaller (so as to fill the space with dots).


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.36

- Download and try out <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/random_walk_demo2.py" download>**random_walk_demo2.py**</a> several times. 

- Modify the code so that the function `do_walk()` takes in the starting point `(X,Y)` as parameters i.e., `do_walk(X,Y)`

- Call `do_walk(X,Y)` three times with different starting points.

- **Submit your program `random_walk_demo2.py`.** with the above modifications.
:::

:::{.callout-tip}
- The submission requires only the program `random_walk_demo2.py` with modifications outlined herein. 
- When executed the code will generate the expected graphs as described in the problem.
- **You are not required submit any graphs generated by the program.**   
:::

**We're now finally ready for the art project:**

- We'll start different random walks at randomly selected starting points, and then draw each in a random color.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 4.37
- **This exercise is to help you develop an understanding of random walks through an art form.**  

  - Download and try out <a href="../../../media/units/unit1/module1.4/random_walk_art.py">**random_walk_art.py**</a> several times. 

  - Try to modify it to improve the (artistic) outcome. 
  - Understand how the changes you made affected the art you created and enjoy you results.
  - Print out your art form and frame it when you complete this module!

- **There is nothing to submit in this exercise.**

:::

**About random walks (in science):**

- Although a random walk might seem like a silly exercise, the idea has had significant scientific impact.
- For example, a version of random walk is the basis for modeling <em>diffusion</em> and <em>osmosis</em>.
- The same basic idea underlies <em>Brownian motion</em> and Einstein's demonstration of the existence of molecules.
- A random walk on networks (as opposed to 2D space) is what launched Google. 
- Evolution is often modeled as a random walk on an abstract representation of the space of DNA sequences.
- Is that enough to believe in the importance of random walks?
