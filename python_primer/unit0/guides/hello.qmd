## Objectives
We will now have you <em>type</em>, </em>run</em>, and save your first <em>computer program</em>.

::: {.callout-note}
- Programs are <em>typed</em> in using your computer's keyboard, just as you would type in an email or text document. 
- And just as the "thing you are typing into" is different for email and for text-editing, there is a different "thing" to type programs into.
- The <em>typing</em> is one part of getting a program. If you just type your program, it will just be sitting there on your computer. But you want to go the next step and <em>run</em> (or, execute, as we say) the program. Typing and not-running is loosely analogous to typing an email but not <em>sending</em> it (the email will just remain in composed-form, but go nowhere). Similarly, typing text into Word doesn't mean it gets "published".
- The "thing" into which you type and run your program is called a <em>code editor</em> or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, a mouthful).
- We are going to give you the option of using one of two code editors, <em>Thonny</em> or <em>Spyder</em>. Think of them as apps that help you type and run programs.
:::

Before we get to typing in a program, we first (if not already done) need to download and <em>install</em> Python and either **Thonny** or **Spyder**.

- The term <em>install</em> means: you download software on your computer and get it to run. This is something you do just once.
- When you need to run the software again, you search for it on your computer (since it's already installed) and merely run it.
- Thus, you will perform <b>Steps 1 and 2 just once</b> for this course.
- And <b>Steps 3 and 4</b> repeatedly as you write code.
- Also, if you start off with one editor and change your mind, you can come back here to install the other editor and learn how to use it.

#### **Step 1: Install Anaconda**
Pick between these two options and click through to follow instructions in installing Anaconda.

- [**Anaconda for Mac users**](hello.qmd#install-anaconda-mac)
- [**Anaconda for Windows users**](hello.qmd#install-anaconda-win)

<em>Then come back here and proceed with Step 2.</em>

Incidentally, you might be asking: what exactly is Anaconda and what does it have to do with Python other than its name?

- Python is a programming language. Typically a language alone is not enough to get many useful programming tasks done.
- We need additional software that's useful. Anaconda is a bundle that includes Python and this additional software. You install it once on your computer and you can then avail of all kinds of useful things related to Python.
- The one thing it does not have, sadly, is the Thonny editor, so we'll show you how to install that.

#### **Step 2: Install a code editor**
Select ONE of the following options:

- Mac _(Option A)_: [**Thonny for Mac users**](hello.qmd#install-thonny-mac)

- Mac _(Option B)_: **There are no special instructions because Spyder comes bundled with Anaconda**.

- Windows _(Option A)_: [**Thonny for Windows users**](hello.qmd#install-thonny-win)

- Windows _(Option B)_: **There are no special instructions because Spyder comes bundled with Anaconda**.



#### **Step 3: Open a code editor**
Choose between:

- Mac _(Option A)_: [**Looking for and opening Thonny**](hello.qmd#open-thonny-mac)

- Mac _(Option B)_: Looking for, and opening Spyder on a Mac is similar to looking for and opening Thonny.

- Windows _(Option A)_: [**Looking for and opening Thonny**](hello.qmd#open-thonny-win)

- Windows _(Option B)_: Looking for, and opening Spyder on Windows is similar to looking for and opening Thonny.



#### **Step 4: Type and Execute `test.py`**
Choose between:

- Mac _(Option A)_: [**Helloworld for Mac users using Thonny**](hello.qmd#hello-thonny-mac)

- Mac _(Option B)_: [**Helloworld for Mac users using Spyder**](hello.qmd#hello-spyder-mac)

- Windows _(Option A)_: [**Helloworld for Windows users using Thonny**](hello.qmd#hello-thonny-win)

- Windows _(Option B)_: [**Helloworld for Windows users using Spyder**](hello.qmd#hello-spyder-win)


#### **Step 5: Install matplotlib for Thonny users**
What is matplotlib? It's a plotting package that we'll use. This comes packaged with Spyder and so, only Thonny users need to download this. Thonny is a nice editor and so Thonny users cheerfully do this additional step in order to use plotting along with Thonny. 

- Mac Users: [**Install matplotlib for Thonny**](hello.qmd#install-matplotlib-mac)

- Windows Users: [**Install matplotlib for Thonny**](hello.qmd#install-matplotlib-win)

#### **Step 6: Install matplotlib on Spyder**
If you are using Spyder that comes bundled with Anaconda Navigator you don't have to do anything extra as matplotlib comes packaged with Spyder. You can verify that you have matplotlib on your computer by following these steps:

- Mac Users: [**Install matplotlib on Spyder**](hello.qmd#install-matplotlib-spyder-mac)

- Windows Users: [**Install matplotlib on Spyder**](hello.qmd#install-matplotlib-spyder-win)


## macOS Users
### Step 1: Installing Anaconda
<div id="install-anaconda-mac"></div>

Learn how to install **Anaconda** and open _Spyder_ (which comes bundled with Anaconda) by following [**this guide**](./anaconda-mac.qmd).


### Step 2: Installing Thonny
<div id="install-thonny-mac"></div>

Learn how to install **Thonny** by following [**this guide**](./thonny-mac.qmd).


### Step 3: Opening Thonny
<div id="open-thonny-mac"></div>
These screenshots explain how to open Thonny:

#### **3.A.1**

#### **3.A.2** 
![](../../../media/hello/spotlight-thonny-2.png)

#### **3.A.3** 
![](../../../media/hello/spotlight-thonny-3.png)

#### **3.A.4** 
You now have opened Thonny
![](../../../media/hello/spotlight-thonny-4.png)


:::{.callout-tip}
- When you open Thonny you aren't opening program files (yet). It's similar to opening Word without naming a text file to work on.
- Your program files are going to be in specific folders. You need to look for them, and when you create new ones, save them in specific folders.

### Step 5: Installing Matplotlib (or any package) for Thonny Users
<div id="install-matplotlib-mac"></div>

How to add a package (like Matplotlib):

- To add a package (which will only be necessary for those using Thonny), first, open Thonny, and go to "**Tools**". From there, click on "**Manage Packages**".
    ![](../../../media/hello/matplotlib/step1mac.jpg)

- Then, you will see a window like what is shown in the image above. Search for the "**package**" you need to install or remove. In this case, we have used the example of "**Matplotlib**", which you will need to have installed for some exercises. Once you've typed the name of the package, click "**Find package from PyPI**" or press the enter/return key.
    ![](../../../media/hello/matplotlib/step2.png)

- To add the package, click the install button. You will then see a small popup while the package is installed.

### Step 6: Installing Matplotlib on Spyder
<div id="install-matplotlib-spyder-mac"></div>

Matplotlib comes packaged with Spyder if accessed through Anaconda Navigator, so you dont really have to do anything extra. To verify you have matplotlib, try importing matplotlib in your console

```python
import matplotlib
```
