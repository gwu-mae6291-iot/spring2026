## Objectives
By the end of this module, for simple programs with real numbers, you will be able to:

- Create variable declarations for variables.
- Assign values to variables by simple assignment, and print them out.
- Demonstrate ability to perform operations 
      for a desired output.
- Evaluate expressions with variables in them.
- Convert English descriptions of operations into expressions.
- Mentally trace execution with expressions and calculations.
- Mentally trace expressions and calculations inside for-loops.
- Produce desired output using for-loops and calculations.
- Identify new syntactic elements related to the above.



## 6.0 What are real numbers?
Let's start with some math facts:

- Whole numbers like 3, 42 and 1024 are <em>integers</em>.
  <br> (As an aside: integers include 0 and the negative ones like -2 or -219).
- The collection of all integers is infinite in size.
- But integers are limited because some operations on integers do not yield integers:
    - 30 &div; 5 gives 6, which is an integer.
    - But 31 &div; 5 is not an integer, yet it's a quantity.
- Real numbers <em>include all the integers</em> but also numbers like 3.141, and -615.2368.
- The collection of all real numbers is also infinite. Interestingly, it's a bigger kind of infinite (but that's a rather subtle math argument outside the scope of this course).
- The term <em>real</em> is just that: a term that's came about historically to describe all these numbers.
- You might wonder: is there any other kind of number?
- Turns out: yes, there a fascinating (and extraordinarily useful) kind of number called an <em>imaginary</em> number, or more generally, a <em>complex</em> number.
    <br> (We won't be working with these in his course.)
- What does one do with real numbers?
    - The same operations: +, -, *, /
    - What's nice is that applying these to real numbers will always result in real number results.
- For example:
    
    ```python
    x = 3.14
    y = 2.718
    z = x + y
    print(z)

    w = z * (x + y) / (x - y)
    print(w)
    ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.1

Type up and submit the above in `my_real_example1.py`. Confirm that the operations on real number should output a real number in this exercise.
:::

:::{.callout-note}

- You might have seen 5.8580000000000005 as the value of z printed out.
- However, you might also have seen something slightly different because of the <em>approximate</em> nature of such calculations, a limitation of computer hardware.
- These tiny errors are tiny indeed, but vary slightly from one computer to another, generally occuring around the 16th decimal place: 0.00000000000000001
- Do we need to worry about this? Only if we are engaged in complex scientific calculations.
- Occasionally, however, it can matter. For example, if two people calculate mortgage interest (with real consequences) slightly differently, it could lead to a legal conflict.
:::

Quick review of some relevant math:

- One kind of operation that's useful is <em>power</em>.
- We write 2<sup>6</sup> to mean 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (six times)
- It's easy to see that you could make this work for real numbers that get multiplied: 2.56<sup>6</sup> =  2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56
- But could you do 2<sup>6.4</sup>? Turns out, yes, you can do this even if it's not easy to see or intuit.
    <br>(We would expect 2<sup>6.4</sup> to be larger than 2<sup>6</sup> and smaller than 2<sup>7</sup>, which it is.)
- The next step then is to allow numbers like 2.56<sup>6.4</sup>.
- In fact, you can take any real number as the <em>mantissa</em> (the 2.56 in 2.56<sup>6.4</sup>) and any real number as the <em>exponent</em> (the 6.4 in  2.56<sup>6.4</sup>).
- Let's put this in code and introduce a new operator to raise a number to a power, as in 2.56<sup>6.4</sup>).

    ```python
    x = 2 ** 6
    print(x)

    y = 2.56 ** 6.4
    print(y)
    ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.2

Type up the above in `my_real_example2.py`. 

- Don't submit it yet. 
- Now consider the equation 2.56<sup>z</sup> = y. You need to use Python to provide a real number input to the value z such that the value of y becomes 400. 
- Type up you lines of Python code to compute the value of y and include them below what you typed already. 
- Check if the value of y is approximately 400 by initalizing the value of z = 6.4. 
- You don't have to be accurate. Try chaning the value of z to a number greater than 6.4 and then lower than 6.4 to see how close you can get to 400. 
- Again, don't worry about the correct answer and focus on the syntax and the outout of your program.
- Submit hte program `my_real_example2.py` with the value of x that in your attempts gets the value of y closest to 400. 
:::

Let's explore further:

- The technical term for "what is x that would make 2.56<sup>x</sup> = 400?" is <em>logarithm</em>.
- We would say: x = log<sub>2.56</sub>(400).
  <br> (Read this as: x is equal to log of 400 to the base 2.56).
- We can calculate this directly:

    ```python
    import math

    x = math.log(400, 2.56)
    print(x)
    ```

- Here we've introduced some new concepts:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/real1.png)
- Just like you can ask Python to calculate logarithms using `math.log`, you can do other kinds of "calculator" functions conveniently.
- **Example**: `math.sqrt` for square roots.


:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.3

Compute the square root of 2 in this exercise. 

In `my_real_example3.py`, fill in code below that prints the square root of the number 2 (and only the square root - just one number).

```python
import math

# Write a line of code here

print(x)
```
:::


## 6.1 Going from reals to integers and strings
Consider this program:
```python
import math

x = 3.141
print('x=' + str(x))

i = math.floor(x)
j = math.ceil(x)
print('Rounding down x gives ' + str(i))
print('Rounding up x gives ' + str(j))
```

:::{.callout-tip}
- The <em>floor</em> function identifies the integer part of a number like 3.141, in this case 3.
- <em>ceil</em> identifies the next higher integer, in this case 4.
- So, any number with digits after the decimal point like 3.141 lies between its floor and ceiling.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.5

Type the above in `my_real_example4.py`. 

- Don't submit it yet. 
- Add additional lines of code to print the floor and ceiling of 2.718 in the same way that the floor and ceiling of 3.141 were printed above. 
- The lines of code shown below are incomplete. 
- You should complete the additional lines of the code required in this exercise, and run the program to make sure you are getting the output desired. 
- Submit `my_real_example4.py`

```python
y = 2.718
print('y=' + str(y))

m = math.floor()
n = math.ceil()
print('Rounding down y gives ' + str(m))
print('Rounding up y gives ' + str(n))
```
:::

Let's point out a few things:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/real2.png)

Next, getting real numbers as input:
```python
import math

# input always results in a string
x_str = input('Enter a number: ')

# This is how we convert a string into a real number:
x = float(x_str)

# We use str to embed a number in a string:
print('The square of the number you entered is: ' + str(x*x))
```

:::{.callout-note}
- We use the `int()` function to convert a string representation of an integer into an actual integer ready for arithmetic, as in:
    
    ```python
    pounds_str = input('Desired flour in pounds: ')
    pounds = int(pounds_str)
    ounces = 16 * pounds
    print('Flour amount in ounces: ' + ounces)
    ```

- The equivalent for real numbers is float:

    ```python
    x = float(x_str)
    ```

- Why is it called so?
    - Observe that we can write the number 234.56 as 23.456 x 10<sup>1</sup> or as 2.3456 x 10<sup>2</sup> or as 0.23456 x 10<sup>3</sup>, or to exaggerate this idea: 0.000000000023456 x 10<sup>13</sup>
    - The decimal point can thus, be "floated" around by adjusting the exponent (like 13).
    - This is called <em>floating-point</em> notation.
- So, what does it mean to have a string representation of a number versus the actual number?
    - First, consider this program:
        
        ```python
        some_string = '3.141'
        x = float(some_string)
        # Now we can use x in arithmetic
        y = x / 2
        ```
<ul>
- We cannot use `some_string` in arithmetic.
</ul>
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.6
The following does NOT work:
```python
x = '3.141'
y = x / 2
print(y)
```
Type up the above program in `my_real_example5.py` 

- Fix it and make sure you program is running correctly.
- Don't submit it yet. 
- Add a few lines of code to print the output of `z = x * 2`, correctly. 
- You should complete the additional lines of the code required in this exercise, and run the program to make sure you are getting the output desired. 
- Submit `my_real_example5.py`
:::

The last exercise illustrates the strange way in which operators like + and * are repurposed for strings when used with strings:

- Consider this example:
    
    ```python
    s = 'Hello'
    t = ' World'
    u = s + t
    print(u)
    v = s * 3   # Makes 3 copies of s and concatenates them
    print(v)    # Prints HelloHelloHello
    ```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.7

Type up the above in `my_string_example.py`, including the comments provided and submit your program.

:::



Now, back to real numbers.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.9

In `my_conversion_example.py` write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, and then converts to miles and prints that number. Submit `my_conversion_example.py`. 
:::

## 6.2 Real numbers and loops
There are two ways in which we'll work with real numbers and loops:

- The first will use integers to <em>drive</em> the loop's iterations as in:
    
    ```python
    for k in range(1, n):
        # do stuff
    ```
Here, `k`, `1`, and `n`, are all integers.

- The second is more advanced in that real numbers can themselves be used in the range. We'll tackle this approach later but we'll give you a preview of what it looks like:

    ```python
    for r in np.arange(0.1, 1, 0.2):
        # do stuff
    ```

Let's start with an example:
```python
num_years = 5
interest_rate = 5.0
amount = 80

for year in range(1, num_years + 1):
    interest = (interest_rate/100) * amount
    amount = amount + interest
    print('After ' + str(year) + ' years,', end='')
    print('amount = ' + str(amount))
```

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.11

Type up the above in `my_compound_interest.py`. 

- Submit `my_compound_interest.py` to complete this exercise.
- The following part of the exercise is not required for submission. However, it is important for you to complete it on your own to understand the working of the program `my_compound_interest.py`. 
- To confirm your output can you calculate the final amount printed?
- Trace through the iterations above using a table in a spreadsheet or a document, tracking the variables year, amount, interest.
:::

Let's point out:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/real3.png)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.12

In `my_compound_interest2.py`, write two successive (not nested) for-loops to compare what happens when $1000 is invested for 20 years in each of two mutual funds, one of which has an annual growth rate of 3%, and the other 8%. 

- Write your program so that it only prints at the end of the program, and prints the amount by which the 8% fund exceeds the 3% fund (at the end of 20 years). 
- Now you know what a 401-K program is about.
:::

## 6.3 Some Greek history via programming
<div id="zeno"></div>
Zeno's paradox:

- Zeno was a Greek philosopher famous for creating several apparent paradoxes.

- His most famous one: the hare and the tortoise
    - Suppose a hare and tortoise are separated by 1 unit of distance, for example: 1 mile.
    ![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/zenodiagram.PNG)
    - Suppose hare is twice as fast as tortoise.
- In the time the hare covers 1 unit, the tortoise has moved foward 1/2 unit.
- In the time taken to cover this 1/2 unit, the tortoise has moved forward 1/4 unit ... etc.
- Zeno claimed that by the time the hare catches up, the tortoise will have traveled:
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    *1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...*
    <br>(The dots at the end indicate "keep adding these terms forever")
- This is an infinite sum. He said: if you add an infinite number of numbers, you'll get something infinitely big.
- Thus, Zeno's paradox is: the hare will never catch up.
- Let's resolve this by writing a program to compute
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    *1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...*
- Such a sum is often called a <em>series</em>.
- Let's write a program to compute this for any number of terms in the series.
- We'll start by noticing that each successive term is half the previous one:
    - 1/4 is half of 1/2.
    - 1/8 is half of 1/4.
    - 1/16 is half of 1/8.
    - ... and so on.
- To compute half of something, we multiply by 1/2.
- Here's the program:
    
    ```python
    n = 5
    total = 0
    term = 1/2
    for k in range(n):
        total = total + term
        term = term * (1/2)

    print(total)
    ```



:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.14

Type up the above in `my_zeno.py` and submit it.

- The following part of the exercise is not required for submission. However, it is important for you to complete it on your own to understand the working of the program `my_zeno.py`. 
- To confirm your output can you calculate the final amount printed? 
- Trace through the values of each of the variables using a table in a spreadsheet or a document.
:::

Let's point out:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/real4.png)

## 6.4 A statistical application
Let's use a loop to compute that most basic of statistical things: an average

For example, suppose we wish to compute the average of the numbers from 1 to 10:
```python
n = 10
total = 0

for k in range(1, n+1):
    total = total + k

avg = total / n
print('Average=' + str(avg))
```
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/real5.png)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.15

Type up the above in `my_stats1.py` to calculate the average and submit it.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.16

In `my_stats2.py`, modify the above code to compute the average of odd numbers from 1 through 9, and check against the answer you get computing by hand. 

- Now, use your program to compute the average of odd numbers between 1 and 100.
- Your final `my_stats2.py` should compute the average of odd numbers between 1 and 100.
- Submit `my_stats2.py`
:::

We'll next look at a problem at the intersection of language and statistics:

- Many <em>nouns</em> in English are long, especially words ending in "tion" like "conservation".
- In contrast, we see a lot of short <em>verbs</em> like "go", "eat" and so on.
- So, is it true that English nouns are, on average, longer than English verbs? Let's find out.
- One way to do this is to get all nouns and all verbs, compute average lengths and compare.
- However, we'll do this statistically by randomly sampling nouns and verbs. 
    <br> (Because this is the "stats" section of the module, after all.)
- We'll provide most of the code, leaving you to fill out one line:
    
    ```python
    import wordtool

    n = 10
    total = 0

    for k in range(1, n+1):
        word = wordtool.get_random_noun()
        # FILL IN THE MISSING LINES HERE:

    avg = total / n
    print('Average word length = ' + str(avg))
    ```

![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/real6.png)

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.17
Type up the above program in `my_stats3.py`.

Download <a href="../../../media/useful/wordtool.py" download >**wordtool.py**</a> and <a href="../../../media/useful/wordsWithPOS.txt" download>**wordsWithPOS.txt**</a> to the same folder where `my_stats3.py` is saved.

Complete the missing lines in `my_stats3.py` to

- print 10 words that are nouns and 
- calculate the average length of the 10 words
- print the average length of the 10 words

Submit `my_stats3.py` after completing and running the program.
:::

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.18
In the earlier program `my_stats3.py`, you 

- printed 10 nouns and 
- estimated the average length of 10 nouns.

In `my_stats4.py`, modify the above program `my_stats3.py` and have it also estimate the average length of verbs. 

This means you will have to add a few more lines of code within the for-loop that does the following:  

- print 10 nouns
- calculate the average length of the 10 nouns
- print 10 verbs
- calculate the average length of the 10 verbs
- print the average length of the 10 nouns
- print the average length of the 10 verbs

You will need <a href="../../../media/useful/wordtool.py" download >**wordtool.py**</a> and <a href="../../../media/useful/wordsWithPOS.txt" download>**wordsWithPOS.txt**</a> again for this exercise. However, you don't need to download them again. Just save `my_stats4.py` in the same folder where you downloaded **wordtool.py**, **wordsWithPOS.txt** and `my_stats3.py`.

**Submit `my_stats4.py` with n = 10.**

Try this experiment; you don't need to submit the following part of the exercise:

- Since the program prints out the average length of the 10 nouns and 10 verbs, you can see the results and mentally compare the average lengths. 
- Try changing n = 100 and see if the results of average lengths are any different.
- Try a higher number for n. You may end up spending more time waiting for the program to complete its execution.
:::

## 6.5 Plotting a function
Let's plot the well-known \(\sin\) function.

- We'll plot this in the range *[0,10]*.
- Let's start by picking 20 points to plot.
- We'll divide the interval *[0,10]* into 20 so that the *x* values (along the x-axis) are
```
    0
    0.5
    1.0
    1.5
    ... (20 equally spaced values along x-axis)
    9.5
    10.0
```

- Pictorially, this is what we've done so far

![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/funcplot.png)

- Then, the y-values are calculated by <em>applying</em> the function:
```
    f(0)    = sin(0)      =  0 
    f(0.5)  = sin(0.5)    =  0.48
    f(1.0)  = sin(1.0)    = 0.84
    f(1.5)  = sin(1.5)    = 0.997
    ... 
    f(9.5)  = sin(9.5)    = -0.075
    f(10.0) = sin(10.0)   = -0.54
```
- For now, don't worry about the meaning of this sin function. 
    - Just think of it as, you give it a value like 0.5, and it gives back a number like 0.005.
    - We'll say more about this below.

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.19

Use a scientific calculator (included in every laptop) to calculate the sin values for the 20 input values beginning with 0, 0.5, 1, ... etc .. until 10. Then plot this by hand on paper. There is nothing to submit in this exercise
:::



Let's now do the plotting in code:
```python
from drawtool import DrawTool 
import math

dt = DrawTool()
dt.set_XY_range(0,10, -2,2)
N = 20
x_spacing = 10 / N
x = 0
for k in range(0, N):
    y = math.sin(x)
    dt.draw_point(x, y)
    x = x + x_spacing

dt.display()
```  

:::{.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon=false}
### Exercise 6.22

Download <a href="../../../media/useful/drawtool.py" download >**drawtool.py**</a> into your module6 folder. Then type up the above in `my_functionplot.py` and execute. Change `N` to 100. This should produce a smoother curve. Next, change the statement 
```python
for k in range(0, N):
```
to
```python
for k in range(1, N+1):
```
- Submit `my_functionplot.py` with `N = 100`

- Review the change in the for-loop statement and explain to yourself why this does not change the results in the python-file. You can discuss this aspect of the exercise with your TA, if necessary.
:::

Let's point out:
![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/real7.png)

:::{.callout-note}
- Much of the complication in this program comes from how we <em>use</em> another program in our program:
    - To perform plotting or drawing, we will use the `drawtool.py` program.
    - To use this program involves many types of statements, such as:
        
        ```python
        dt = DrawTool()
        dt.set_XY_range(0,10, -2,2)
        ```
    among others.
    - There are aspects we're not going to be able to understand now, but we can at least use the program.
- Notice that when N=20, the spacing is 10/20 (which is equal to 0.5).
- If a higher value of N were used, we'd have smaller spacing and therefore a smoother curve.
:::

About mathematical functions:

- The term <em>function</em> means different things in programming and math.
- For us in programming, a function is a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name and used multiple times just by using that name.
- In math, a function is a calculation mechanism, which we can think of as "something that takes in a number and outputs a number via a calculation":
    - For example:
    ![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/func1.png)
    - In this particular case, suppose we feed in 8, we get 64
    ![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/func2.png)
    - The rule that turns the input number into the output number is: multiply the input number by itself.
    - Thus: 8<sup>2</sup> = 64
    - To describe this in a simpler way, we use symbols like x
    ![](../../../media/units/unit0/module6/func3.png)
    - And instead of drawing boxes, we use mathematical notation like this: f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>.
    - Read this as: the function takes in a number x and produces x<sup>2</sup>.
- There are a gazillion functions, some of which are well-known and have stood the test of time.
- Amongst these well-known functions are the trigonometric functions like sin.
- Thus, sin(x) takes in a number x and produces a number as a result.
- In the early 1600's Rene Descartes made a startling discovery that dramatically changed the world of math:
    - You can make axes.
    - For every possible x you can compute f(x)
    - Then draw each pair x, f(x) as a point.
    - This produces a curve that allows one to <em>visualize</em> a function.
- This is what we did when we plotting the sin function.

About the sin function:

- You may vaguely recall trigonometry from high-school, or have happily forgotten it.
- Perhaps you recall triangles and ratios of sides.
- The sin function arose from those ideas.
- While silly little triangles may seem a mere high-school math exercise, it turns out that functions like sin have proven extraordinarily useful both in real-world applications and in pure mathematics.
- We're not going to require much math knowledge in this course but will make observations from time to time.


## 6.6 Plotting a curve with data
Next, let's work with some real data

Consider the following data:

Let's write code to display this data:
```python
from drawtool import DrawTool 
import math

dt = DrawTool()

dt.set_XY_range(0,120, 0,20000)

x = 8.33
f = 1666.67
dt.draw_point (x, f)

x = 22.22
f = 3666.67
dt.draw_point (x, f)

x = 23.61
f = 4833.33
dt.draw_point (x, f)

x = 30.55
f = 5000
dt.draw_point (x, f)

x = 36.81
f = 5166.67
dt.draw_point (x, f)

x = 47.22
f = 8000
dt.draw_point (x, f)

x = 69.44
f = 11333.33
dt.draw_point (x, f)

x = 105.56
f = 19666.67
dt.draw_point (x, f)

dt.display()
```

### Exercise 6.23

You already have <a href="../../../media/useful/drawtool.py" download >**drawtool.py**</a> in your module6 folder. Type up the above in `my_dataplot.py` and run. 

- Submit `my_dataplot.py`
- Observe the points "sort of" along a jagged line. 
- This is actual scientific data from observations made in 1929 by a scientist named Edwin HUbble. It utterly shattered our perception of the world. For the purposes of understanding data do some research on your own to identify what this was about and undestand its' significance?

## 6.8 About the reals, and math in general
We've gone a bit beyond our comfort zone into real numbers and into some applications.

We'll end this module by pointing out a few more things about numbers in a mathematical sense, and say something about <em>math anxiety</em>. None of this will be on any exam. 

Let's start with numbers:
    
- The easiest kind of number to understand are the <em>natural numbers</em>.
    - They are the numbers 1, 2, 3 ... and so on.
    - It's an infinite set, and many operations like + and * applied to naturals result in a natural.
    - But 3 - 5 is not a natural number, and neither is $$ \frac{3}{5} $$.
    - So, they're limited in their use.
- If we expand the naturals and add 0, and all the negative numbers, we get 
    $$
            \ldots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \ldots
    $$
    (The triple-dot that indicates "going on forever" occurs now on both sides, the positive side and the negative side.)
    - However, they too are limited because neither $$ \frac{3}{5} $$ nor $$ \frac{5}{3} $$ are integers.

- The next kind of number to consider is <em>rational number</em>:
    - A rational is a number that can be written as a fraction (or ratio) of integers.
    - Examples: $$ \frac{5}{3}, \frac{46}{7} $$
    - They include all the integers.
- Then we get to the real numbers introduced in this module.
- Within the real numbers there are interesting categories.
- Some real numbers are <em>irrational</em> and cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.
    - One example is $$ \sqrt{2} $$, which bedeviled the Greeks a long time ago.
    - Interestingly, one can prove that there are many more irrational real numbers than rational real numbers.
- Another kind of real number is an <em>algebraic number</em>,  meaning they are the solution to an equation like $$ 3x^2 + 5 = 11 $$
- Those that aren't algebraic go by the lovely name of 
      transcendental number, such as $$ pi $$
- So, is every number a real number?
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rArr; 
    No, there are numbers like $$ \sqrt-1 $$ that are <em>imaginary</em>.
- You might think that an imaginary number couldn't possibly have any use. It turns out that they are extraordinarily useful in many kinds of practical applications.
    - Example: processing any kind of "wave" data, such as brain waves or seismic waves.
    - Example: quantum computing.

Some ideas to reflect on:

- Which of the following most resonates with you?
    - "I've always found math very hard and prefer to avoid it."
    - "I can tolerate math but would rather avoid it if possible."
    - "Math and I just don't get along."
    - "Math is OK - I can do most of it but I don't find it interesting or valuable."
    - "I can do math but am more interested in just applying it."
    - "I find math really interesting, even if I choose not to pursue math for math's sake."
    - "I love math and will do as much of it as I can."
- What ever your category, you should keep in mind:
    - Math is a skill and takes practice, just like programming.
    - Yes, it's true that a lot of high-school is boring. Much of what's interesting in math comes after calculus.
    - The notion of not being suited to math is just a mindset. It can be changed.
    - Even a little math is quite useful.
    - You can learn quite a bit of math via programming, as we'll show you.
- We'll have more to say about the interesting and exciting connections between computer science, math, and other fields, including art.
