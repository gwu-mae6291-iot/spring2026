Be sure to use a for-loop to repeatedly print one letter in the sound. Write your code in my_pet_sound_loop.py.\n\n\nLet’s zoom in on the for-loop and examine it.\nTo do so, we’ll write a different for-loop:\nfor i in range(6):\n    print(i)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.3\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_forloop_example.py and run it.

    "text": "3.1 Variations\nTo explore for-loops further, we’ll look at some variations of the basic for-loop:\n1. First, we could have named our for-loop variable\nfor count in range(6):\n    print(count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt’s customary to use short variable names like i and j\n\n\n2. To go through a loop five times, any range of numbers will do:\nfor i in range(10, 16):\n    print(i)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nHere, the range feature has both a starting value (10) and just-after-ending value (16) specified.\nThis will print the numbers 10 through 15.\n\n\n\n3. We don’t have to increment the for-loop variable by 1.\nfor i in range(10, 16, 2):\n    print(i)\n\nThis prints the numbers 10, 12, 14.\nThe number 2 in range(10, 16, 2) specifies an increment amount.\nThus, we start with i taking the value 10 in the first iteration.\nIn the second iteration, i becomes 12 (because 10+2 = 12).\nIn the third iteration, i becomes 14 (incrementing 12 by 2).\nIf we were to increment 14 by 2 it becomes 16 which is past the last value allowed.\nImportant: think of 16 as “the variable cannot have this value or anything past this value”.\n\n4. We can decrement, as in:\nfor i in range(16, 10, -1):\n    print(i)\n\nThis will print 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11.\nWe start with 16 (the first part of the range).\nAfter each iteration we apply the increment/decrement amount.\nIn this case, applying -1 to 16 gives us 15, which gets printed.\nThen, the third time through, i becomes 14. And so on.\nIn the last iteration, i becomes 11.\nFinally, when i is decremented to 10, the loop is ended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.6\n\n\n\nType up the above four examples in my_forloop_variation1.py, my_forloop_variation2.py, my_forloop_variation3.py, and my_forloop_variation4.py. Run to confirm the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.7\n\n\n\nIn count_odd_up.py, write a loop to print the odd numbers from 1 to 25 (thus, skipping by 2, and including 1 and 25 in the output).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.8\n\n\n\nIn count_even_down.py, write a loop to print the even numbers from 24 down to 2 (inclusive of 24 and 2)."

(Or, stated differently, ends the current line being printed.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.10\n\n\n\nAdd a row for 5 (with five of them), writing your code in my_forloop_print.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.11\n\n\n\nJust for the heck of it, could one use a for-loop to achieve the printing of 1 all by itself? That is, can a for-loop be set up so that you go into it exactly once? Write you code in my_forloop_print2.py\n\n\nNext, observe that the upper-limits of the for-loops are themselves increasing: \nAlso, observe that the very thing we’re printing across a row is the loop limit itself: \nAnother way to say this: \n\nWhen the value is 2, print a row of two 2’s When the value is 3, print a row of three 3’s When the value is 4, print a row of four 4’s\n\n\nThus, we could try to do is:\nfor j in range(2, 5):   # let j iterate from 2 to 4\n    # print j occurences of j using a loop\nBut we already know how to print a row of j’s:\nfor j in range(2, 5):   # let j iterate from 2 to 4\n    # print a row of j's (j of them)\n    for i in range (j):\n        print(j, end='')\nLet’s put this together in a complete program:\nprint(1)                   # print 1 all by itself\n\nfor j in range(2, 5):      # j iterates from 2 to 4\n    for i in range(j):     # for each j, print j of them\n        print(j, end='')\n    print()    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.13\n\n\n\nChange the program to print a fifth row with five 5’s. Also adjust the for-loop so that the for-loop also takes care of printing the sole 1 that appears in the row of the sole 1’s. That is, adjust the for-loop conditions so that you don’t need the stand-alone print(1) to print 1. Write your code in my_forloop_print3.py.\n\n\nLet’s review what we learned above:\n\nThe outer loop variable’s value is used in the inner loop: \nConsider a single iteration of the outer-loop (e.g., when j is 3). \n\nFor this value of j, the inner loop executes j times.\nThus, when j is 3, the inner loop has 3 iterations.\n\nThis is an example of a nested for-loop in which the inner loop’s execution depends on the value of the outer-loop variable.\nAnother way to say it: a nested for-loop has one for-loop inside another.\nWe will use nesting in other contexts as well, when one structure is placed inside another."

Likewise, with numbers, Python will add them.\n\nYou may have noticed the words all strung together without a space.

Hopefully, with hilarious results.\nWe’ll point out one other new thing:\nsentence = (\n    'The ' + adj + ' ' + noun + ' ' + verb + 's' +\n    ' ' + prep + ' a ' + noun2)\n\nHere, we are concatenating many strings into a long one.\nHowever, if it’s unwieldy to type them all in one line, we can spill over into multiple lines.\nOne way to do that is to use parentheses as shown above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.8\n\n\n\nOpen wordtool.py and examine the functions within. Use wordtool.py and follow the earlier program, my_random_sentence.py to create a program, my_random_sentence2.py that generates a longer random sentence.

    "section": "6.0 What are real numbers?",
    "text": "6.0 What are real numbers?\nLet’s start with some math facts:\n\nWhole numbers like 3, 42 and 1024 are integers.  (As an aside: integers include 0 and the negative ones like -2 or -219).\nThe collection of all integers is infinite in size.\nBut integers are limited because some operations on integers do not yield integers:\n\n30 ÷ 5 gives 6, which is an integer.\nBut 31 ÷ 5 is not an integer, yet it’s a quantity.\n\nReal numbers include all the integers but also numbers like 3.141, and -615.2368.\nThe collection of all real numbers is also infinite. Interestingly, it’s a bigger kind of infinite (but that’s a rather subtle math argument outside the scope of this course).\nThe term real is just that: a term that’s came about historically to describe all these numbers.\nYou might wonder: is there any other kind of number?\nTurns out: yes, there a fascinating (and extraordinarily useful) kind of number called an imaginary number, or more generally, a complex number.  (We won’t be working with these in his course.)\nWhat does one do with real numbers?\n\nThe same operations: +, -, *, /\nWhat’s nice is that applying these to real numbers will always result in real number results.\n\nFor example:\nx = 3.14\ny = 2.718\nz = x + y\nprint(z)\n\nw = z * (x + y) / (x - y)\nprint(w)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.1\n\n\n\nType up and submit the above in my_real_example1.py. Confirm that the operations on real number should output a real number in this exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nYou might have seen 5.8580000000000005 as the value of z printed out.\nHowever, you might also have seen something slightly different because of the approximate nature of such calculations, a limitation of computer hardware.\nThese tiny errors are tiny indeed, but vary slightly from one computer to another, generally occuring around the 16th decimal place: 0.00000000000000001\nDo we need to worry about this? Only if we are engaged in complex scientific calculations.\nOccasionally, however, it can matter. For example, if two people calculate mortgage interest (with real consequences) slightly differently, it could lead to a legal conflict.\n\n\n\nQuick review of some relevant math:\n\nOne kind of operation that’s useful is power.\nWe write 26 to mean 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (six times)\nIt’s easy to see that you could make this work for real numbers that get multiplied: 2.566 = 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56\nBut could you do 26.4? Turns out, yes, you can do this even if it’s not easy to see or intuit. (We would expect 26.4 to be larger than 26 and smaller than 27, which it is.)\nThe next step then is to allow numbers like 2.566.4.\nIn fact, you can take any real number as the mantissa (the 2.56 in 2.566.4) and any real number as the exponent (the 6.4 in 2.566.4).\nLet’s put this in code and introduce a new operator to raise a number to a power, as in 2.566.4).\nx = 2 ** 6\nprint(x)\n\ny = 2.56 ** 6.4\nprint(y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.2\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_real_example2.py.\n\nDon’t submit it yet.\nNow consider the equation 2.56z = y. You need to use Python to provide a real number input to the value z such that the value of y becomes 400.\nType up you lines of Python code to compute the value of y and include them below what you typed already.\nCheck if the value of y is approximately 400 by initalizing the value of z = 6.4.\nYou don’t have to be accurate. Try chaning the value of z to a number greater than 6.4 and then lower than 6.4 to see how close you can get to 400.\nAgain, don’t worry about the correct answer and focus on the syntax and the outout of your program.\nSubmit hte program my_real_example2.py with the value of x that in your attempts gets the value of y closest to 400.\n\n\n\nLet’s explore further:\n\nThe technical term for “what is x that would make 2.56x = 400?” is logarithm.\nWe would say: x = log2.56(400).  (Read this as: x is equal to log of 400 to the base 2.56).\nWe can calculate this directly:\nimport math\n\nx = math.log(400, 2.56)\nprint(x)\nHere we’ve introduced some new concepts: \nJust like you can ask Python to calculate logarithms using math.log, you can do other kinds of “calculator” functions conveniently.\nExample: math.sqrt for square roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.3\n\n\n\nCompute the square root of 2 in this exercise.\nIn my_real_example3.py, fill in code below that prints the square root of the number 2 (and only the square root - just one number).\nimport math\n\n# Write a line of code here\n\nprint(x)"

You can discuss this aspect of the exercise with your TA, if necessary.\n\n\n\nLet’s point out: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the complication in this program comes from how we use another program in our program:\n\nTo perform plotting or drawing, we will use the drawtool.py program.\nTo use this program involves many types of statements, such as:\ndt = DrawTool()\ndt.set_XY_range(0,10, -2,2)\namong others.\nThere are aspects we’re not going to be able to understand now, but we can at least use the program.\n\nNotice that when N=20, the spacing is 10/20 (which is equal to 0.5).\nIf a higher value of N were used, we’d have smaller spacing and therefore a smoother curve.\n\n\n\nAbout mathematical functions:\n\nThe term function means different things in programming and math.\nFor us in programming, a function is a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name and used multiple times just by using that name.\nIn math, a function is a calculation mechanism, which we can think of as “something that takes in a number and outputs a number via a calculation”:\n\nFor example: \nIn this particular case, suppose we feed in 8, we get 64 \nThe rule that turns the input number into the output number is: multiply the input number by itself.\nThus: 82 = 64\nTo describe this in a simpler way, we use symbols like x \nAnd instead of drawing boxes, we use mathematical notation like this: f(x) = x2.\nRead this as: the function takes in a number x and produces x2.\n\nThere are a gazillion functions, some of which are well-known and have stood the test of time.\nAmongst these well-known functions are the trigonometric functions like sin.\nThus, sin(x) takes in a number x and produces a number as a result.\nIn the early 1600’s Rene Descartes made a startling discovery that dramatically changed the world of math:\n\nYou can make axes.\nFor every possible x you can compute f(x)\nThen draw each pair x, f(x) as a point.\nThis produces a curve that allows one to visualize a function.\n\nThis is what we did when we plotting the sin function.\n\nAbout the sin function:\n\nYou may vaguely recall trigonometry from high-school, or have happily forgotten it.\nPerhaps you recall triangles and ratios of sides.\nThe sin function arose from those ideas.\nWhile silly little triangles may seem a mere high-school math exercise, it turns out that functions like sin have proven extraordinarily useful both in real-world applications and in pure mathematics.\nWe’re not going to require much math knowledge in this course but will make observations from time to time."

    "text": "6.8 About the reals, and math in general\nWe’ve gone a bit beyond our comfort zone into real numbers and into some applications.\nWe’ll end this module by pointing out a few more things about numbers in a mathematical sense, and say something about math anxiety. None of this will be on any exam.\nLet’s start with numbers:\n\nThe easiest kind of number to understand are the natural numbers.\n\nThey are the numbers 1, 2, 3 … and so on.\nIt’s an infinite set, and many operations like + and * applied to naturals result in a natural.\nBut 3 - 5 is not a natural number, and neither is \\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\].\nSo, they’re limited in their use.\n\nIf we expand the naturals and add 0, and all the negative numbers, we get \\[\n          \\ldots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \\ldots\n  \\] (The triple-dot that indicates “going on forever” occurs now on both sides, the positive side and the negative side.)\n\nHowever, they too are limited because neither \\[ \\frac{3}{5} \\] nor \\[ \\frac{5}{3} \\] are integers.\n\nThe next kind of number to consider is rational number:\n\nA rational is a number that can be written as a fraction (or ratio) of integers.\nExamples: \\[ \\frac{5}{3}, \\frac{46}{7} \\]\nThey include all the integers.\n\nThen we get to the real numbers introduced in this module.\nWithin the real numbers there are interesting categories.\nSome real numbers are irrational and cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.\n\nOne example is \\[ \\sqrt{2} \\], which bedeviled the Greeks a long time ago.\nInterestingly, one can prove that there are many more irrational real numbers than rational real numbers.\n\nAnother kind of real number is an algebraic number, meaning they are the solution to an equation like \\[ 3x^2 + 5 = 11 \\]\nThose that aren’t algebraic go by the lovely name of transcendental number, such as \\[ pi \\]\nSo, is every number a real number?        ⇒ No, there are numbers like \\[ \\sqrt-1 \\] that are imaginary.\nYou might think that an imaginary number couldn’t possibly have any use. It turns out that they are extraordinarily useful in many kinds of practical applications.\n\nExample: processing any kind of “wave” data, such as brain waves or seismic waves.\nExample: quantum computing.\n\n\nSome ideas to reflect on:\n\nWhich of the following most resonates with you?\n\n“I’ve always found math very hard and prefer to avoid it.”\n“I can tolerate math but would rather avoid it if possible.”\n“Math and I just don’t get along.”\n“Math is OK - I can do most of it but I don’t find it interesting or valuable.”\n“I can do math but am more interested in just applying it.”\n“I find math really interesting, even if I choose not to pursue math for math’s sake.”\n“I love math and will do as much of it as I can.”\n\nWhat ever your category, you should keep in mind:\n\nMath is a skill and takes practice, just like programming.\nYes, it’s true that a lot of high-school is boring. Much of what’s interesting in math comes after calculus.\nThe notion of not being suited to math is just a mindset. It can be changed.\nEven a little math is quite useful.\nYou can learn quite a bit of math via programming, as we’ll show you.\n\nWe’ll have more to say about the interesting and exciting connections between computer science, math, and other fields, including art."

    "text": "3.2 Using a Boolean variable\nTo see how a Boolean variable is used in practice, we will work through a somewhat elaborate example that will teach us other useful things.\nLet’s start with this program:\ndef print_search_result(A, search_term):\n    if search_term in A:\n        print('Found ', search_term)\n\nB = [15, 3, 23, 9, 14, 4, 6, 2]\nprint_search_result(B, 4)\nIn the above example program, the goal is to create a function that takes a list, and a search value (or search term) and looks inside the list to see if it exists.\nDoes the program work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.8\n\n\n\nType up the above program in my_search_example.py to confirm.\nSubmit your program my_search_example.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nWe have exploited the in-operator in Python to examine whether or not an element exists in a list:\nif search_term in A:\nThis will return either True or False.\nAnd Python does the work of traversing the list and peeking inside to see if value (4 in this case) is in the list.\n\n\n\nNow consider the problem of also printing the position where it’s found:\ndef print_search_result(A, search_term):\n    for k in range(len(A)):\n        if A[k] == search_term:\n            print('Found', search_term, 'at position', k)\n\nB = [15, 3, 23, 9, 14, 4, 6, 2]\nprint_search_result(B, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.9\n\n\n\n\nTo check if the above program works, type it up in my_search_example2.py.\nMake any changes required to make sure that the program prints the position where element of the list is found.\n\nSubmit your program my_search_example2.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nWe are now traversing the list ourselves:\nfor k in range(len(A)):\nHere, the variable k will start at 0 and go up to the last index (one less than the length of the list).\nAt each iteration, the program checks to see if the search term is equal to the list element at the current position (determined by k):\nif A[k] == search_term:\nIf the condition above evaluates to True, it means the program found the list element we are looking for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.10\n\n\n\nThere is nothing to submit in this exercise.

Building numbers (they are technically called pointers) are handled by Python, and made invisible to us because we don’t need them.  (Yes, we can print the building number if we wish, but that’s an advanced topic.)\n\n\n\nWe obviously want to know: is it possible to create a complete copy of A in B? As in: \nBecause then, if we change A, it does not affect B: \nThis is what it looks like in code:\nA = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\nprint(A)     # A = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n\nB = A.copy() # This is NOT the same as B = A\n\nA[0] = 49    # Change some value in list A\n\nprint(A)     # A = [49, 4, 9, 16, 25]\nprint(B)     # Does it affect what's in list B?\n             # No, B = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n             # After the line of code B = A.copy(),\n             # any change in elements of A, DOES NOT make\n             # a corresponding change in elements of B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.12\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_list_copy2.py to find out if any values have changed in list B.\nSubmit my_list_copy2.py.\n\n\nSo, which (B = A or B = A.copy()) do we use?\n\nGenerally, you should use A.copy() unless you intentionally want the same “building number”.\nIn that, you have to be careful."

5:\n    x = x + 10\nelif x &gt; y:\n    if (x &gt; 0) and (x+y &gt; z):\n        if c == 'a':\n            print('yes, a')\n        else:\n            if c == 'b':\n                print('no, b')\n    else:\n        print('boo')\nelse:\n    print('ok, that is enough')\nWe’ll do this in steps, working from the “outside going in”:\n\nWe’ll start by noticing some variables and values being assigned, followed by a large nested conditional: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe conditional has both an elif and anelse` code block.\nThe conditions depend on the variables that precede it.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we identify which part of the outer conditional executes: \nThen, working inwards, we examine and see that the elif code block is itself a big conditional: \n\nThe combined Boolean expression\nif (x &gt; 0) and (x+y &gt; z):\ndoes turn out to be True, and so we enter the if-block that follows: \nThe if-condition below fails:\nif c == 'a':\nand so execution proceeds into the else-block: \n\n\n\n\nClearly, in this case, the condition succeeds and we get to the print: \nObserve that if the condition was\nif c == 'z':\nthen we would jump right out of the whole: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis example illustrates how critical it is to make sure the indentation is correct.\n\n\n\nFor example, consider these three variations:\n\nIndent-case #1:\nif c == 'a':\n    print('yes, a')\nelse:\n    if c == 'b':\n        print('no, b')\n        print('hello')\nIndent case #2:\nif c == 'a':\n    print('yes, a')\nelse:\n    if c == 'b':\n        print('no, b')\n    print('hello')\nIndent case #3:\nif c == 'a':\n    print('yes, a')\nelse:\n    if c == 'b':\n        print('no, b')\nprint('hello')\nCan you see why they’re all different?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.2\n\n\n\n\nType up the following program in my_execution_practice2.py.\n\nx = 7\ny = 6\nz = 5\nc = 'b'\n\nif x &lt;

The judgement comes with practice.\nGenerally, tiny computations like increment don’t need functions.\nAny significant computation that is likely to be re-used should probably be in a functions.\nUse functions when breaking things into functions greatly improves readability."

    "section": "2    Why does CS have math in it? And how much?",
    "text": "2    Why does CS have math in it? And how much?\n\n\n\nThe first few courses in computer science are:\n\nCS-1111: Introduction to Software Development.\nThis is the introductory programming course for majors in the Java programming language. The good news is, you are primed for success in this course because you already know key concepts such as loops, conditionals and functions.\nCS-1112: Algorithms and Data Structures.\nRemember lists, arrays, sets, and dictionaries? This course dives deep into these structures and also spends time on algorithmic ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou need to have completed Math-1220 or Math-1231 to take this course. And a minimum grade of C in CS-1111.\nMath-1220 or Math-1231 are different versions of Calculus.\n\n\n\nCS-1311: Discrete Structures.\nThis is the second math course, and the first “math in CS” course. Here’s what you should know about CS-1311: even if math did not work out for you in high-school, CS-1311 might be fine if you really work at it. CS-1311 does not require any of the traditional pre-calc math (trigonometry etc) as background, but you do need to be comfortable with symbols and algebra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou need to have completed Math-1220 or Math-1231 to take this course.\n\n\n\nCS-2113: Software Engineering .\nThis is the third in the programming sequence where you’ll learn to write more sophisticated code to build real applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis has a prerequisite of CS-1112 (with a minimum grade of C), and you need to have completed Math-1231 or the combination of 1220 and 1221 to take this course.\n\n\nSo, now let’s answer a few questions about math:\n\nWhat kinds of math, and how much?.\n\nThe minor requires two math courses:\n\nCalculus, which can be taken as a single intensive course (Math-1231) or as two courses (Math 1220 and 1221).\nDiscrete-structures (CS-1311), which is a more CS-related math course offered by the CS department itself.\n\nIn addition to Calculus and Discrete structures, the B.A in CS major requires a statistics elective (which you are likely to take in almost any major) and a Linear Algebra course.\nIn addition to Calculus and Discrete structures, the B.S in CS major has four additional math courses: Discrete Structures II, Foundations of Computing, Statistics, and Linear Algebra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe BS program has a specific list of Statistics courses that are allowed, which does NOT include the oft-taken 1051 or 1053. (The BA does allow 1051/3).\n\n\n\nWhy is there math in CS? Programming doesn’t appear to need math.\n\nWhile it’s true that you don’t need any math to program websites or write code for mobile apps, computer science is a lot more than just programming. For instance, artificial intelligence is an area of computer science that seeks to build programs that rival (in fact, exceed) humans in intelligence. There’s a fair amount of math behind this type of computing. Other areas that overlap with math include: cryptography, data science, robotics, graphics.\nA lot of computer science becomes interesting if you are willing to take on a reasonable amount of math.\nTheoretical computer science, which is quite mathematical, asks fundamental questions about the theory behind computing. For example, if you’ve wondered why the Python compiler can’t tell whether your program will run correctly, it’s because we can (mathematically) prove that no such compiler can be created.\n\nAre there options if I’m not interested in doing the math?.  Yes. See the “Post-graduation online programs” section below."

    "text": "0.1 Arrays: a more efficient type of list\nWhile lists are useful and easy to use, they are a bit inefficient “under the hood”:\n\nVery large lists (million elements and higher) can slow down a program.\nAnd a list-of-lists is even slower for large sizes, and takes up unneccessary extra space (compared to arrays).\nSome of the most compelling uses involve the array equivalent of a list-of-lists-of-lists: an image.\nAs we will see, a regular color image will turn out to be a three dimensional array while a black-and-white image will turn out to be a two-dimensional array.\n\nAbout arrays:\n\nArrays were created as a separate structure in Python to enable efficient processing of lists of numbers, especially multidimensional lists.\nBecause arrays are in a separate part of Python, the syntax around arrays is a bit different, for example:\nA = np.array([1,2,3,4])\nArrays constitute a large topic in Python, and its advanced features can be fairly complex.\nOur goal here is only a light introduction so that we can work with images.\n\nLet’s start with an example of a single dimensional array, the cousin of a plain list:\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.array([1,2,3,4])\n\nprint(type(A))             # What does this print?\nA[1] = 5                   # Replace 2nd element\nprint(A)                   # [1 5 3 4]\nprint(A.shape[0])          # 4\nprint('len(A)=',len(A))    # 4\n\n# A[4] = 9\n# A.append(9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.4\n\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_array_example.py along with the comments.\nSubmit your program my_array_example.py.\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:\n\nTry un-commenting in turn each of the two commented-out lines at the end, and understand the errors that were produced.\nRestore your program by commenting out both.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s point out a few things:\n\nTo gain efficiency, arrays trade away some flexibility and ease of use.\nFor example, we now need to import this special package called numpy:\nimport numpy as np\nOnce we do this, the syntax for making an array with actual data is, as we’ve seen:\nA = np.array([1,2,3,4])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA brief aside on the Python keyword as:\n\nWe use as to create shortcuts.\nWe could write the above code as show below:\nimport numpy\nA = numpy.array([1,2,3,4])\nThe as keyword lets us create a short form.\nWe could have made it even shorter:\nimport numpy as n\nA = n.array([1,2,3,4])\nbut this is frowned up on Python culture.\nOver time, a sort-of convention about naming has taken place in Pythonworld.\nWhich is why you’ll see all example code using numpy as np. End of digression.\n\n\n\nNotice that that actual data that is fed into an array function of numpy is a list:\nimport numpy as np\nA = np.array( [1,2,3,4] )\nThe actual array so created is in fact in the variable A.\nTo work with elements in the array, we use square brackets with the variable A:\nA[1] = 5                   # Replace 2nd element\nThe standard function len() works as we expect:\nprint('len(A)=',len(A))\nHowever, the array has a feature that is more general called shape:\nprint(A.shape[0])          # 4\n\nAt first this seems cumbersome, and for single-dimensional arrays, it is.\nBut for multiple dimensions, it’s convenient to have the length of each dimension handy.\nThis is what shapehas.\nshape[0]has the first dimension (the length of the array along the first dimension).\nshape[1]has the length along the second-dimension, and so on.\nOf course, for a single dimensional array, there’s only shape[0].\n\nOne of the efficiency tradeoffs is that an array has a fixed size. Which means, to add a new element, we have to rebuild the array.\nThus, to add an element in the above example, we need to write:\nA = np.append(A, 9)\nprint(A)        # [1 5 3 4 9]\nThis creates a new array with the added element.\nTypically most scientific applications do not change sizes on the fly, and so, this is not a serious restriction.\n\nNumpy has powerful features that simplify manipulation of numeric arrays.\nFor example, consider the following program:\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nB = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n\nC = A + B            # Direct element-by-element addition\nprint(C)             # [5 7 9]\n\nD = np.add(A, B)     # The same, via the add() function in numpy\nprint(D)             # [5 7 9]\n\nE = B - A            # Elementwise subtraction\nprint(E)             # [3 3 3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.5\n\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_array_example2.py.\nAdd a line that multiplies the arrays A and B element-by-element, and prints the result [ 4 10 18].\n\nHint: Use np.multiply()\n\nSubmit your program my_array_example2.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.6\n\n\n\nlet’s remind ourselves about how lists work.\n\nType up the following program in my_list_version.py:\n\n\nX = [1, 2, 3]\nY = [4, 5, 6]\nZ = X + Y\nprint(Z)          # What does this print?\n\n# Write code here to compute Z as element-by-element addition\n# of X and Y (to give [5, 7, 9])\n\nprint(Z)\n\nThen add code to perform element-by-element addition.\nSubmit your program my_list_version.py.\n\n\n\nNumpy also has a number of functions that act on arrays and return arrays, for example:\n\nOne can apply a function like square-root element-by-element:\nA = np.array( [1, 4, 9, 16] )\nB = np.sqrt(A)\nprint(B)        # [1. 2. 3. 4.]\nOne of the most convenient is to have numpy create an array with random elements:\n\nNumpy has its own random-generation tool:np.random\nThis has a function randint() that takes the desired range (inclusive of first, excluding last), and the desired size of the array.\n\n# Roll a die 20 times\nA = np.random.randint(1, 7, size=20)  \nThis produces an array of size 20 with each element randomly chosen from among the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nOne can also test membership using the in operator:\n\nFor example, suppose we roll a die 20 times and want to know whether a 6 occured:\n# Roll a die 20 times\nA = np.random.randint(1, 7, size=20)  \nif 6 in A:\n    print('Yes, there was a 6')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.7\n\n\n\n\nIn my_dice_problem.py fill in code below to estimate the chances that you get a total of 7 at least once when rolling a pair of dice 10 times.\n\nsuccesses = 0\nnum_trials = 1000\nfor n in range(num_trials):\n    # Fill your code here\n\nprint( successes/num_trials )\n\nTo do so, generate one array called A of length 10 with random numbers representing one die (selected from 1 through 6).\nThen generate a second array called B that represents the 10 rolls of the second die.\nA success occurs when A[i]+B[i] is 7 for some i.\n\nSubmit your program my_dice_problem.py.\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:\n\nCan you solve this without actually accessing the i-th element in a loop?"

    "text": "0.2 2D arrays\nHere, 2D is short for two-dimensional.\nLet’s begin with a conceptual depiction of a 1D (one-dimensional) array:\n\nFirst, suppose we create an array of 5 numbers as in:\nA = np.array([50, 55, 60, 65, 70])\nA convenient way to visualize this is to draw these numbers in a series of adjacent “boxes” as shown below: \nBecause we need a way to use our keyboard to enter elements, we use a particular kind of syntax, comma-separation with square-brackets to specify the elements.\nWe use a similar type of syntax to access a particular element in this array, as shown below:\nprint(A[2])\nWe can also change an element in an array:\nA[2] = 61\nwhich will result in the visualization\n\n\nTo explain how a 2D array works, let’s start with its conceptual visualization, via an example:\n\nConsider this visualization of a 2D array: \nWe use the term row to describe the contents going across one of the series of boxes going left to right: \nAnd the term column (shortened to col in our pictures) to describe the series of boxes going vertically top to bottom: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe number of elements in a row is the number of columns.\nThe number of elements in a column is the number of rows.\n\n\n\n\nAgain, because our limited keyboard doesn’t let us draw boxes, we need a way to type in a 2D array. We do so by writing out a 2D array as a series of comma-separated rows:\nA = np.array([ [ 50,  55,  60,  65,  70],\n            [   100, 105, 110, 120, 125],\n            [   150, 155, 160, 165, 170],\n            [   200, 205, 210, 215, 220] ])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the above example of 2D numpy array, we’ve added whitespace (that’s allowed) to line up the rows so that it’s as close to our visual understanding as possible.\n\n\nTo access a particular element, we need the row number and column number, as in:\nprint(A[1,3])     # NOT A[1][3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nImportant:\n\nIn a list-of-lists box-separation is used in indexing.\n\n# List of lists:\nX = [ [2,4,6,8,10], [1,3,5,7,9] ]\nprint(X[0][2])\n\nIn numpy arrays comma-separation is used in indexing.\n\n# 2D array:\nX = np.array([ [2,4,6,8,10], [1,3,5,7,9] ])\nprint(X[0,2])\nUnfortunately, arrays allow box-separation as well (for access) but this causes problems in other array operations (slicing): so please use comma-separation with a single set of square brackets for arrays.\n\n\n\nJust as we used a for-loop for a single array, it is very typical to use a nested for-loop for a 2D array:\n\nFor comparison, let’s look at a 1D array:\nA = np.array( [1, 4, 9, 16] )\nfor i in range(A.shape[0]):        # Recall: A.shape[0] is the size\n    print(A[i])\nThe equivalent for a 2D array is:\nA = np.array([ [50,   55,  60,  65,  70],\n            [100, 105, 110, 120, 125],\n            [150, 155, 160, 165, 170],\n            [200, 205, 210, 215, 220] ])\n\nfor i in range(A.shape[0]):        # number of rows\n    for j in range(A.shape[1]):    # number of columns\n        print(A[i,j])\nTo make the code a bit more readable, we could write\nnum_rows = A.shape[0]\nnum_cols = A.shape[1]\nfor i in range(num_rows):\n    for j in range(num_cols):\n        print(A[i,j])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.9\n\n\n\nConsider this conceptual 2D array:\n\n\nIn my_2D_array.py, write code to create the array.\nThen write a nested for-loop to print the array so that the output has one row on each line, with whitespace between elements, as show below:\n\n10  12  15  \n6  8  10  \n2  -1  -5  \n-4  4  5  \n\nSubmit your program my_2D_array.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.10\n\n\n\n\nIn my_2D_array2.py, use the same array above and structure a nested for-loop to compute the sum of elements down each column so that the output is:\n\nColumn 0 total is 14\nColumn 1 total is 23\nColumn 2 total is 25\n\nSubmit your program my_2D_array2.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAbout 2D arrays:\n\nAlthough our examples show arrays of integers, the Numpy package supports a wide variety of data types, including floats, chars, strings and such.\nThere are even specially “compacted” versions of integers to enable working with extremely large arrays.\nThere are two common (and quite different) uses of 2D arrays:\n\nOne is for a mathematical construct called a matrix, which you’d learn in a course called linear algebra.\nThe other is for images, which we’ll look at next."

Whereas our eye can see the individual pixels in the example above, a regular image has thousands of pixels, which is enough to fool the eye.\nIn a color image, as we will later see, we’ll need three numbers for each pixel (the amounts of red, green, blue).\nAbout the greyscale machine pictured above:\n\nThis is an image of the ACE computer, one of the world’s earliest computers, designed by none other than Alan Turing, computer science pioneer and WWII hero.\nTo give you a sense of how primitive these were, your laptop with 8GB RAM has more than 60 million times the memory of the ACE. And yet, the ACE was a landmark technological wonder at its time.\n\n\n\nLet’s now work with an actual image:-\nfrom drawtool import DrawTool\nimport numpy as np\n\ndt = DrawTool()\ndt.set_XY_range(0,10, 0,10)\ndt.set_aspect('equal')\n\ngreypixels = dt.read_greyimagefile('eniac.jpg')\n# greypixels is a 2D array\n\ndt.set_axes_off()\ndt.draw_greyimage(greypixels)\n\n# Add code to print the number of rows, number of columns\n# Should print: rows = 189  columns = 267\n\ndt.display()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.14\n\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_image_example3.py and download eniac.jpg.\nAdd code to print the number of rows and number of columns\n\nHint: some_variable.shape[0] relates to the rows and em&gt;some_variable.shape[1] relates to the columns\n\n\nSubmit your program my_image_example3.py. - We are only looking for a working program i.e., my_image_example3.py.\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission: - Spend 15 minutes learning about the ENIAC, its inventors, its significance, and write a short paragraph about this in your pdf.\n\n\nImage formats:\n\nWhen an image is stored as a file, the file needs to contain all the integers that comprise the 2D array (for greyscale images)\nLarge images can take quite a bit of space. For example, a 1000-row x 1000-column image will have one million pixels.\nYet many images have vast expanses of the same color or intensity and they offer a chance to compress (use less space by being clever).\nImage formats arose as a result of wanting to both compress the storage and to store meta-info about images.\nPopular formats include: JPG, PNG, TIFF and Bitmap.\nTypically the last part of the filename (the “.jpg” in “eniac.jpg”) tells you the format.\nPython provides a way of reading from these formats so that we don’t have to worry about the details.\n\nLet’s now modify a greyscale image:\nfrom drawtool import DrawTool\nimport numpy as np\n\ndt = DrawTool()\ndt.set_XY_range(0,10, 0,10)\ndt.set_aspect('equal')\n\ngreypixels = dt.read_greyimagefile('eniac.jpg')\n\ngreypixels2 = np.copy(greypixels)\nnum_rows = greypixels2.shape[0]\nnum_cols = greypixels2.shape[1]\n\nlightness_factor = 10\n\nfor i in range(num_rows):\n    for j in range(num_cols):\n        value = greypixels[i,j] + lightness_factor\n        if value &gt; 255:\n            value = 255\n        greypixels2[i,j] = value\n\ndt.set_axes_off()\ndt.draw_greyimage(greypixels2)\n\n# To save an image, use the save_greyimage() function:\n# dt.save_greyimage(greypixels2,'eniac-light.jpg')\n\ndt.display()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.15\n\n\n\n\nType up the above program in my_image_example4.py and save it in the same folder where you downloaded drawtool.py and eniac.jpg in the earlier exercise.\nExecute the program my_image_example4.py\nChange the lightness_factor to 100.\nSubmit your program my_image_example4.py.\n\nWe are only looking for a working program i.e., my_image_example4.py.\n\n\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission: - Try different values (in the range 10 to 100) of the lightness_factor and observe the change in the image."

    "text": "0.4 A color image is a 3D array of integers\nAbout color images:\n\nIn a color image, each pixel will have a color instead of a “greyness” factor.\nUnfortunately, one cannot easily represent colors with a single number.\nThere are many ways of using multiple numbers to encode colors.\nWe’ll use the most popular one: specify the strengths of the three primary colors (Red, Green, Blue).\nThis approach is so popular that we refer to it simply as RGB.\nThe “amount” of red is a number between 0 and 255, the amount of green is another such number, as is the amount of green.\nThus, each color is a triple of numbers, for example:\n\n(255,0,0) is all red (no green, no blue)\n\n  \n\n(0,255,0) is all green (no red, no blue)\n\n  \n\n(0,0,255) is all blue (no red, no green)\n\n  \n\n\nLet’s try a few more:\n\n(255,255,0)\n\n  \n\n(100,255,255)\n\n  \n\n(200,200,200)\n\n  \n\n(grey is R,G,B all equal)\n(0,0,0)\n\n  \n\n(255,255,255) is white\n\n\nWhen each pixel needs three numbers and there’s a grid of pixels, how do we store the numbers?\n\nWe use a small array (of size 3) to store the triple.\nThen each pixel in the 2D array of pixels will have an array of size 3.\nThis is a 3D array!\n\nLet’s look at an example:\nfrom drawtool import DrawTool\nimport numpy as np\n\ndt = DrawTool()\ndt.set_XY_range(0,10, 0,10)\ndt.set_aspect('equal')\n\npixels = np.array(\n    [ [ [255,0,0], [200,0,0], [150,0,0], [50,0,0] ], \n      [ [255,50,0], [200,100,0], [150,150,0], [50,200,0] ], \n      [ [255,50,50], [200,100,100], [150,150,150], [50,200,200] ], \n      [ [0,50,50], [0,100,100], [0,150,150], [0,200,200] ], \n      [ [0,0,50], [0,0,100], [0,0,150], [0,0,200] ]\n  ]) \n\n\ndt.set_axes_off()\ndt.draw_image(pixels)\n\ndt.display()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.17\n\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_color_example.py and save it in the same folder where you downloaded drawtool.py\nWhen you run the program, you should see the following result:\n\n\n\n\nSubmit your program my_color_example.py.\n\nWe are only looking for a working program i.e., my_color_example.py.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s point out the structure inherent in the above 3D array: \nNext, let’s work with actual color images with an example application: converting color to greyscale:\nfrom drawtool import DrawTool\nimport numpy as np\n\ndt = DrawTool()\ndt.set_XY_range(0,10, 0,10)\ndt.set_aspect('equal')\n\n# The image file is expected to be in the same folder\npixels = dt.read_imagefile('washdc.jpg')\n\nnum_rows = pixels.shape[0]\nnum_cols = pixels.shape[1]\n\ngreypixels = dt.make_greypixel_array(num_rows, num_cols)\nfor i in range(num_rows):\n    for j in range(num_cols):\n        # Average of red/green/blue\n        avg_rgb = (pixels[i,j,0] + pixels[i,j,1] + pixels[i,j,2]) / 3\n        # Convert to int\n        value = int(avg_rgb)\n        greypixels[i,j] = value\n\ndt.set_axes_off()\ndt.draw_greyimage(greypixels)\n\n# Notice: saving to a different image format (PNG):\ndt.save_greyimage(greypixels, 'washdc-grey.png')\n\ndt.display()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.18\n\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_color_example3.py and download washdc.jpg.\nExecute the program my_color_example3.py\n\nThe program should convert and save the color image into a greyscale and save it in your folder with a filename, washdc-grey.png.\n\nSubmit your program my_color_example3.py.\n\nWe are only looking for a working program i.e., my_color_example3.py.\n\n\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:\n\nTry and figure out file size of the original versus the new greyscale one.\nFind out more about JPG vs PNG formats of images, to understand why PNG format needs more storage space than the JPG format.\n\n\n\nNext, consider the following program:\nfrom drawtool import DrawTool\nimport numpy as np\n\ndt = DrawTool()\ndt.set_XY_range(0,10, 0,10)\ndt.set_aspect('equal')\n\npixels = dt.read_imagefile('washdc.jpg')\n\nnum_rows = pixels.shape[0]\nnum_cols = pixels.shape[1]\n\nfor i in range(num_rows):\n    for j in range(num_cols):\n        if ( (pixels[i,j,1] &gt; pixels[i,j,0]) \n             and (pixels[i,j,2] &lt; 0.5*pixels[i,j,1]) ):\n            pixels[i,j,0] = 0\n            pixels[i,j,1] = 0\n            pixels[i,j,2] = 255\n\ndt.set_axes_off()\ndt.draw_image(pixels)\n\ndt.display()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.20\n\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_color_example4.py. You already have washdc.jpg\nSubmit your program my_color_example4.py.\n\nWe are only looking for a working program i.e., my_color_example4.py.\n\n\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:\n\nTry making the following changes and run your program my_color_example4.py to observe your outputs:\n\n\npixels[i,j,0] = 0\npixels[i,j,1] = 255\npixels[i,j,2] = 0\nand\npixels[i,j,0] = 255\npixels[i,j,1] = 0\npixels[i,j,2] = 0\n\nUnderstand why the image is changing with the above inputs.\n\n\n\nWhat did we just do?\n\nWe are examining the R,G,B values for each pixel, to see if the condition (G &gt; R) and (B &lt; G) is satisfied.\nWhen the condition is satisfied, we are overwriting the pixel with a new (all blue) color.\nWhat we’re trying to do is identify greenery by asking: when do we have the Green value a bit larger than the Red value and much larger than the Blue value?\nWhy is this useful?\n\nThis is essentially what many satellite-image applications do:\n\nidentify areas of interest for urban planning, crop surveys, environmental assessment (think: rainforest), and so on.\n\nNotice that this rule does not capture all greenery."

    "section": "0.5 Arrays and slicing",
    "text": "0.5 Arrays and slicing\nSlicing can be applied to arrays in the same way that we used them earlier for lists with one major difference, as we’ll point out.\nFor example:\nimport numpy as np\n\nprint('list slicing')\nA = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]\nB = A[1:3]                 # B has [4, 9]\nprint(B)\nB[0] = 5                   # B now has [5, 9]\nprint(B)\nprint(A)                   # What does this print?\n\nprint('array slicing')\nA = np.array( [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36] )\nB = A[1:3]                 # B \"sees\" [4, 9]\nprint(B)\nB[0] = 5                   # What happens now?\nprint(B)\nprint(A)                   # What does this print?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.23\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_slicing_example.py.\nSubmit your program my_slicing_example.py. \n\n\nLet’s explain the major difference in list-slicing and array-slicing:\n\nThe slicing expression 1:3in A[1:3] refers to all the elements from position 1 (inclusive) to just before position 3 (so, not including position 3).\nWith lists, a new list is created with these elements:\nA = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]\nB = A[1:3]\nSo, writing into the new list (B) does not affect the old list (A) from which the slice was taken.\nBut with arrays, a slice is only a view as if we were giving a name to a zoomed-in-part:\nA = np.array( [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36] )\nB = A[1:3]\nHere, array B refers to the segment (that’s still in A) from positions 1 to 2.\nThis is why in arrays, if you make a change to B, you are actually changing A.\nWhy did they do this?\n\nThe reason is, many image processing applications require working on parts of images.\nThen, with regular slicing, if we were to pull out parts and modify them, we’d have to write them back in.\nSlicing makes it convenient to write directly into parts of images.\n\n\nSlicing is a big sub-topic so we’ll just point out a few useful things to remember via an example:\nimport numpy as np\n# Color image:\nA = np.array(\n    [ [ [255,0,0], [200,0,0], [150,0,0], [50,0,0] ], \n      [ [255,50,0], [200,100,0], [150,150,0], [50,200,0] ], \n      [ [255,50,50], [200,100,100], [150,150,150], [50,200,200] ], \n      [ [0,50,50], [0,100,100], [0,150,150], [0,200,200] ], \n      [ [0,0,50], [0,0,100], [0,0,150], [0,0,200] ]\n  ]) \n\nB = A[4:5,:,: ]   # The last row\nprint(B) \nC = A[:,1:2,:]    # The second column\nprint(C)\nD = A[:3,:2,:]    # The pixels in rows 0-2 and cols 0-1 \nprint(D)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA different slice can be specified for each dimension of a multidimensional array.\nWhen neither end of a slicing range is specified, that implies all the elements, as in:\nB = A[4:5, :,: ]   # The last row\nHere, the stand-alone colons imply the whole range for the 2nd and 3rd array index positions.\nIt is possible to specify just one limit as in:\nD = A[:3, :2,:]    # The pixels in rows 0-2 and cols 0-1 &lt;\nIn the first (row) case, we’re saying “all rows from the start up to row 2”.\n\n\n\nLet’s apply slicing to creating a cropped image:\nfrom drawtool import DrawTool\nimport numpy as np\n\ndt = DrawTool()\ndt.set_XY_range(0,10, 0,10)\ndt.set_aspect('equal')\n\npixels = dt.read_imagefile('washdc.jpg')\n\n# Crop from row 50 to 179, and column 50 to 199\npixels2 = pixels[50:180, 50:200]\n\ndt.set_axes_off()\ndt.draw_image(pixels2)\n\ndt.display()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 0.24\n\n\n\n\nType up the above program in my_slicing_example2.py. You already have washdc.jpg\nExecute the program my_slicing_example2.py.\nSubmit your program my_slicing_example2.py.\n\nWe are only looking for a working program i.e., my_slicing_example2.py.\n\n\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:\n\nTry changing the cropping in the line pixels2 = pixels[50:180, 50:200] so that the Washington Monument shows up centered in your cropped image, with little else around it."

    "text": "1.0 Tuples\n\nIn this section and the ones that follow, we’ll touch lightly upon a few topics that are or were “not on the exam” but will be useful in general.\nSome of these concepts will be directly used in the next module.\nSuppose we want to write a function that computes both the square and cube of a number:\nOne option is to write two separate functions\ndef square(x):\n    return x*x\n\ndef cube(x):\n    return x*x*x\n\nx = 5\nprint(x, square(x), cube(x))\nWe can alternatively write one function that computes and returns two things:\ndef do_both(x):\n    square = x*x\n    cube = square*x \n    return (square, cube)\n\nx = 5\n(y, z) = do_both(x)\nprint(x, y, z)\nNotice that the return statement returns a pair of values:\nreturn (square, cube)\nAnd that the pair is enclosed in parentheses.\nAnd notice that, since two values are being returned, we need a pair to capture the return values:\n(y, z) = do_both(x)\nWe can go beyond a pair to any number of such “grouped” variables:\ndef do_more(x):\n    square = x*x\n    cube = square*x \n    fourth = cube*x\n    fifth = fourth*x\n    return (square, cube, fourth, fifth)\n\nx = 5\n(a, b, c, d) = do_more(x)\nprint(x, a, b, c, d)\nSuch a grouping of variables is called a tuple.\n\nTuples are similar to lists in many ways, but different in one crucial aspect:\n\nFirst, let’s examine how to write the same do_both() function above but using lists:\ndef do_both_list(x):\n    square = x*x\n    cube = square*x \n    return [square, cube]\n\nx = 5\n[y, z] = do_both_list(x)\nprint(x, y, z)\nThis works just fine.\nAnother way in which a tuple is like a list is in using square-brackets and position indices to access individual elements, as in:\n# List version:\nL = do_both_list(x)\nprint(L[0], L[1])      # L[0] has the square, L[1] has the cube\n\n# Tuple version:\nt = do_both(x)\nprint(t[0], t[1])      # t[0] has the square, t[1] has the cube\nHowever, here’s the difference:\n# List version:\nL = do_both_list(x)\nL[0] = 0              # This is allowed\n\n# Tuple version:\nt = do_both(x)\nt[0] = 0              # This is NOT allowed\nThus, you can replace a list element but you cannot replace a tuple element.\nThis is in fact a bit subtle, as this example shows:\nx = 3\ny = 4\nt = (x, y)   # The tuple's value is now fixed.\nprint(t)     # (3, 4)\nx = 2\nprint(t)     # (3, 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nOnce the tuple is instantiated (that’s the technical term for “made”) then the tuple’s value cannot be changed.\nTuples are immutable.\n\n\n\nYou can of course assign a different tuple value to a tuple variable as in:\nt = (1, 2)\nprint(t)\nt = (3, 4)\nprint(t)\nHere, we’re simply replacing one fixed-value tuple with another.\nTuples are therefore said to be an immutable type.\n\nSimilarly, strings are also an immutable object-type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nWhy use tuples at all?\n\nIt’s to allow programmers to signal clearly that their tuples shouldn’t be changed.\nThis turns out to be convenient for mathematical tuples (like points on a graph), which are similar.\n\n\n\n\nGroups of tuples can be combined into lists and other data structures.\n\nIt’s very useful in working with points (the mathematical point you draw with coordinates) and other mathematical structures that need more than one number to describe.\nFor example, here’s a program that, given a list of points, finds the leftmost point (the one with the least x value).\n\ndef leftmost(L):\n    leftmost_guess = L[0]\n    for q in L:\n        if q[0] &lt; leftmost_guess[0]:\n            leftmost_guess = q\n    return leftmost_guess\n\nlist_of_points = [(3,4), (1,2), (3,2), (4,3), (5,6)]\n(x,y) = leftmost(list_of_points)\nprint('leftmost:', (x,y) )\n# leftmost: (1, 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.1\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_tuple_example.py.\nSubmit your program my_tuple_example.py.\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission: - Trace through the iterations and record them in a separate document or spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.2\n\n\n\nConsider the following:\nimport math\n\ndef distance(p, q):\n    return math.sqrt( (p[0]-q[0])**2 + (p[1]-q[1])**2 )\n\ndef find_closest_point(p, L):\n    # Write your code here to find the closest point in L to p\n    # and to return both the point and the distance to it from p.\n\nlist_of_points = [(3,4), (1,2), (3,2), (4,3), (5,6)]\nquery_point = (5,4)\n\n(c, d) = find_closest_point(query_point, list_of_points)\nprint('closest:',c,' at distance', d)\n# Should print: \n# closest: (4, 3)  at distance 1.4142135623730951\n\nIn my_tuple_example2.py,\n\nFill in the missing code to find the closest point in a list of points to a given query point and\nReturn both the closest point and the distance to the query point as a tuple.\n\nSubmit your program my_tuple_example2.py."

    "text": "1.1 Sets\nThe general mathematical term set means a “collection of like things but without duplicates”.\nPython has special syntax and operations to support this mathematical notion:\n\nHere are two sets being defined:\nA = {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}       # Curly brackets\nB = {'hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'howdy'}\nThe first set contains five numbers, whereas the second contains four strings.\n\nConsider this variation\nA = {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}\nB = {'hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'howdy'}\n\nC = {8, 5, 4, 6, 2, 4, 5, 5}\nprint(C)\nif A == C:\n    print('they are equal')\nelse:\n    print('they are not equal')\nGiven what we’ve said about sets, what will be printed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.3\n\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_set_example.py to find out.\nSubmit your program my_set_example.py.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nEven though a set may not have duplicates, we are actually allowed to try to create duplicates:\nC = {8, 5, 4, 6, 2, 4, 5, 5}\nPython simply removes the duplicates.\nPython also organizes sets so that sets can be compared for equality: Thus, printing the set\nC = {8, 5, 4, 6, 2, 4, 5, 5}\nactually results in\n{2, 4, 5, 6, 8}\n\n\n\nWhat can we do with sets?\n\nThe most common operation is to see whether some value is in some set we’ve defined using the keyword in:\ndef check_vowel(x):\n    vowels = {'a','e','i','o','u'}\n    if x in vowels:\n        print(x, 'is a vowel')\n    else:\n        print(x, 'is not a vowel')\n\ncheck_vowel('a')\ncheck_vowel('b')\nOther, more mathematical operations, feature different ways of combining sets. For example:\nA = {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}\nB = {1, 3, 5, 6}\n\nD = A | B    # union\nprint(D)\nHere, D contains every element across both sets.\nOther such operators include:\n\nintersection (elements that are in both sets)\ndifference (elements in one set that are not in the other)\n\nSince our goal is merely to give you a taste of these advanced topics, we won’t say much more about these operations.\n\nLet’s look at an application:\n\nIn text processing, the term stopword is often used to describe commonly used words that serve little or no purpose in text analysis:\n\nWhen you analyze digitized texts for meaning, topic and dialogue (for example), words like “the”, “of”, “and” get in the way of analysis.\nThey are often discarded from text analysis that seeks to analyze more significant words.\n\nWe’ll ask the question: what proportion of text typically consists of stopwords? (The answer is surprising, as we’ll see).\nTo answer the question, we’ll scan text word-by-word and see if each word is in the set of stopwords.\nAlthough there are hundreds of stopwords, we’ll keep things simple by targeting a few.\n\nLet’s write this up:\nimport wordtool as wt \n\n# The 25 most common stopwords\nstopwords = {'the','be','to','of','and','a','in','that','have','I',\n             'it','for','not','on','with','he','she','you','do','as',\n             'at','his','her','they','by'}\n\nwt.open_file_byword('alice.txt')\n\ns = wt.next_word()\nnum_stopwords = 0\ntotal_words = 0\n\nwhile s != None:\n    if s in stopwords:\n        num_stopwords += 1   # Count stopwords\n    total_words += 1         # And all words\n    s = wt.next_word()\n\npercent_stopwords = 100 * (num_stopwords/total_words)\n# print the following:\nstring_to_print = '% of stopwords:{0:.2f}'.format(percent_stopwords)\nprint(string_to_print)\n# and print the following:\n# print(percent_stopwords)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.4\n\n\n\n\nDownload the text Alice in Wonderland and save it in the same folder as your code\nType up the above program in my_stopwords.py.\nSubmit your program my_stopwords.py.\n\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:\n\nCompare the percentage of stopwords in these two famous texts: Alice in Wonderland and Darwin’s The Origin of the Species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs an aside, we’ll point out something about string formatting, which is also an advanced topic:\n\nIt’s plain ugly (and often useless) to print out all the digits in a floating number like:\n% of stopwords: 31.969357958208498\nInstead, we’d like\n% of stopwords: 31.97\nSpecifying to Python how you’d like a number formatted, unfortunately, is a bit of a chore using somewhat cryptic commands embedded within strings:\nstring_to_print = '% of stopwords:{0:.2f}'.format(percent_stopwords)\nprint(string_to_print)\nWe’ll explain this one with the understanding that a proper look into this topic is beyond the scope of this course:\n\nFirst, one builds the target strings using typical quotes, as in:\nstring_to_print = '% of stopwords: '\nThen, attach the format function with the desired variable whose value we wish to print nicely:\nstring_to_print = '% of stopwords: '.format(percent_stopwords)\nThen, figure out where in the string you want the resulting number and use curly brackets:\nstring_to_print = '% of stopwords: {0}'.format(percent_stopwords)\nHere, 0 means the first such number. If had a second number, we’d use 1, and so on.\nFinally, specify both how many digits after the decimal point, and that this number is a float:\nstring_to_print = '% of stopwords: {0:.2f}'.format(percent_stopwords)\n\nYes, a bit cryptic and difficult to understand. But eventually, when you get used to it, it’s powerful when you are doing a lot of text output."

Prints 3\n\nd['banana'] = 0    \n# Which changes the value associated with 'banana' to 3\nThe above is an example of a dictionary that’s already built (after we’ve processed the data).\nTo process data on-the-fly, we need an additional operation that an English dictionary does not really have:\n\nWe need to be able to add something that’s not already there.\nTo add a new key, we simply use it as an index:\n\nd = {'apple': 3, 'banana': 3, 'pear': 1, 'kiwi': 2, 'orange': 4}\n\nd['plum'] = 0\nWith this understanding we can now revisit the code in the fruit example:\nWe’ve seen how to read a file line-by-line before\nwith open('fruits.txt','r') as data_file:\n    line = data_file.readline()\n    while line != '':\n        fruit = line.strip()           # Remove whitespace on either side\n\n        # This is where we'd do something with the datda\n\n        line = data_file.readline()    # Get the next line\nThe rest is merely the dictionary part:\nwith open('fruits.txt','r') as data_file:\n    line = data_file.readline()\n    while line != '':\n        fruit = line.strip()           # Remove whitespace on either side\n\n        if fruit in counters.keys():\n            # If we've seen the fruit before, increment.\n            counters[fruit] += 1\n        else:\n            # If this is the first time, set the counter to 1\n         counters[fruit] = 1\n\n        line = data_file.readline()    # Get the next line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.7\n\n\n\nUse the knowledge gained from the above example to work on this exercise.\n\nYou should have downloaded the textAlice in Wonderland and saved it in the same folder as your code.\nIn my_stopwords2.py, write code that uses a dictionary to compute the relative occurrence of stopwords in alice.txt.\nFor alice.txt the output should look like this (not necessarily in the same order) using the string formatting from the previous section.\nSubmit your program my_stopwords2.py"

Robustly tested programs can be left alone while refining those that need work.\nSeparated functionality is useful in other projects.\nIf one piece needs upgrading, you can upgrade just that part if it’s in a separate file.\n\n\n\nLet’s build a simple example that we will be using toward submitting the Exercise 1.9:\n\nSuppose we put together a file called my_math_functions.py which has the following code:\nimport math\n\npi = 3.141\n\ndef square(x):\n    return x*x\n\ndef cube(x):\n    return x*x*x\n\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    # Write your code here\nThen in an another file called my_math_application.py you could write the following code:\nimport my_math_functions as m\n\nx = 2\ny = m.square(5)\nprint(y)\n\nx2 = 3\ny2 = m.cube(x2)\nprint(y2)\n\nd = m.distance(x,y, x2, y2)\nprint(d)\nNotice the import statement at the top of the file as shown below:\nimport my_math_functions as m\nThis has the import keyword, the name of the other file, and a shortcut.\nTo access something from another file, we use the dot (period):\ny = m.square(5)\nOne can access a variable in the other file as well.\nprint(m.pi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIf we did not have the shortcut, we’d have to write code like the one shown below:\nimport my_math_functions \n\nx = 2\ny = my_math_functions.square(5)\nprint(y)\nThe above code is perfectly legit but a bit tedious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.9\n\n\n\n\nComplete the code for the function distance() and write the above two programs (viz., my_math_functions.pyand my_math_application.py.

This means a decimal version of a binary number might have to be an approximation.\n\nOK, how do we actually print nicely?\n\nThis is a bit of an advanced topic, so we’ll only provide a simple example.\nThe solution is to use a special set of formatting commands, like the ones you saw a long time ago (remember ?)\n\n\nHere’s how it works for the above program:\nx = 0\nfor i in range(5):\n    format_string = 'i = {0:2d}  x = {1:.2f}'\n    string_to_print = format_string.format(i, x)\n    print(string_to_print)\n    x += 0.1\nLet’s explain:\n\nA format string is the eventual desired string that needs to be printed but with some placeholders:\nformat_string = 'i = {0:2d}  x = {1:.2f}'\nIn this case, there are two placeholders:\nformat_string = 'i = {0:2d}  x = {1:.2f}'\nPlaceholders are enclosed in curly brackets.\nEach placeholder begins with a number that will eventually determine which variable gets its value into the placeholder.\nSo, here we have variables 0 and 1:\nformat_string = 'i = {0:2d}  x = {1:.2f}'\nWe feed the values via the format() function:\nformat_string = 'i = {0:2d}  x = {1:.2f}'\nstring_to_print = format_string.format(i, x)\nThis is what lets format() put the value of i in place of the “0” and the value of x in place of the “1”.\nAll that’s left to explain are the cryptic commands that follow the “0” and “1” respectively:\nformat_string = 'i = {0:2d}  x = {1:.2f}'\n\nThe first one says, in effect, “use a minimum of 2 spaces and expect an integer”.\nThe second says “expect a float and restrict the number of post-decimal digits to 2”.\n\n\nString formatting has more to it, but that’s all we’ll say about it here."

    "text": "1.6 Randomness\nAs we’ve seen throughout the course, it is useful to be able to have Python generate random numbers:\n\nWe use random numbers to answer statistical questions.\nRandom numbers were also useful in creating patterns, as in art.\n\nHowever, there’s an important thing to know about random generation.\nConsider this program:\nimport random\n\n#random.seed(123)\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    x = random.uniform(1.0, 10.0)\n    print(x)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.11\n\n\n\n\nType up the above my_random_example.py.\nRun it multiple times and observe the output.\nNext, un-comment the following line and run it again multiple times:\n\n#random.seed(123)\n\nThen, change the number 123 in the seed to any number between 1 and 1000, and once more run the program many times.\nSubmit your program my_random_example.py by including random.seed(123) to complete this assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow random generation works\n\nPython uses a mathematical function with a so-called “seed” to produce random numbers.\nThe numbers aren’t really random, because a particular seed will produce the same numbers, which is why they’re called pseudorandom numbers.\nHowever, if we’re doing things like computing averages, a pseudorandom sequence, provided it’s long enough, is a reasonably good approximation.\nIs there ever a reason to fix a seed?\n\nTurns out, yes. It’s very useful for debugging.\nUsing a seed causes your program to be repeatable (with the same pseudorandom sequence).\nSo, typically, one uses a seed when getting your program to work.\nAfter it’s working, you can comment out the seed.\n\nIf a seed is not provided, Python uses the local time or something like that as the seed, so that repeated runs produce different results."

    "text": "2.1 CSV data\nWhen hearing buzzwords like “data science” or “data analytics”, one is led to ask: exactly what is meant by data, and what form does it take on computers?\nWe need to be aware of two such forms:\n\nOne is the form it takes as a file.\nThe other is: how do we store it in our Python code?\n\nHere are some basic types of data files:\n\nText data. This is just plain text but can be found (and stored) as files of different kinds: Word files, plain text files (as we’ve seen with our text examples), and webpages (which contain text).\n\nExample: see this file\nHere, the data is in plain text format, which means we can use something like wordtool to iterate through words, letters etc.\nOnce we’ve read the words in the file, our program could store the words in a list.\n\nNumeric-only data. This kind of data is often presented in plain text files:\n\nExample: see this file, which has pressure-difference readings from two weather stations in the Pacific (it’s called the Southern Oscillation, used to predict El-Nino).\nThere’s one reading for each month, a list of 12 numbers.\nNumbers are often stored in arrays inside a program.\n\nImage data. Images are stored in various formats such as JPG or PNG.\n\nExample: see this JPG file.\nAs we’ve seen, a color image is stored as 3D array in a program.\n\n\nCSV files for mixed data:\n\nMost real world data sets combine different data together.\nFor example, even in purely numeric data (such as the weather data example above), we might have multiple “columns” of data as in:\nOscillation  Year          Year       Month\n----------------------------------------------\n-0.7         1955        1955         1\n1.3         1955        1955         2\n0.1         1955        1955         3\n-0.9         1955        1955         4\n0.8         1955        1955         5\n1.6         1955        1955         6\n1.7         1955        1955         7\n1.4         1955        1955         8\n1.4         1955        1955         9\n1.5         1955        1955        10\n1.4         1955        1955        11\n0.9         1955        1955        12\nBut even more commonly, numeric and text data are often found together, as in:\n    city      lat      long       country iso2 iso3  population\n   Tokyo  35.6897  139.6922         Japan   JP  JPN    37977000\n Jakarta  -6.2146  106.8451     Indonesia   ID  IDN    34540000\n   Delhi  28.6600   77.2300         India   IN  IND    29617000\n  Mumbai  18.9667   72.8333         India   IN  IND    23355000\n  Manila  14.5958  120.9772   Philippines   PH  PHL    23088000\nShanghai  31.1667  121.4667         China   CN  CHN    22120000\nSao Paulo -23.5504  -46.6339        Brazil   BR  BRA    22046000\n   Seoul  37.5833  127.0000  Korea, South   KR  KOR    21794000\nMexico City  19.4333  -99.1333        Mexico   MX  MEX    20996000\nGuangzhou  23.1288  113.2590         China   CN  CHN    20902000\nThis type of table-like format is possibly the most common type of data.\nWhile one could store this in a plain text file as in this example, it is much more convenient to use the CSV format.\nThe same data in CSV format looks like this:\ncity,lat,long,country,iso2,iso3,population\nTokyo,35.6897,139.6922,Japan,JP,JPN,37977000\nJakarta,-6.2146,106.8451,Indonesia,ID,IDN,34540000\nDelhi,28.66,77.23,India,IN,IND,29617000\nMumbai,18.9667,72.8333,India,IN,IND,23355000\nManila,14.5958,120.9772,Philippines,PH,PHL,23088000\nShanghai,31.1667,121.4667,China,CN,CHN,22120000\nSao Paulo,-23.5504,-46.6339,Brazil,BR,BRA,22046000\nSeoul,37.5833,127.0,\"Korea, South\",KR,KOR,21794000\nMexico City,19.4333,-99.1333,Mexico,MX,MEX,20996000\nGuangzhou,23.1288,113.259,China,CN,CHN,20902000\n\nWhitespace is removed\nCommas are used to separate data.\n\n\nFor the above example, this is the CSV file, which you can store and open in Excel or Google-sheets.\n\nYou can see why CSV stands for “Comma Separated Values”.\n\nNext, let’s write some code to work with CSV files.\nfrom datatool import datatool\n\ndt = datatool()\ndt.load_csv('cities.csv')\ndt.print_data()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2\n\n\n\nFirst, download cities.csv.

    "text": "2.5 Using datatool for maps\nOne of the more exciting uses of Plotly is to display maps and draw on them.\nLet’s think about what a map really is:\n\nWhereas a standard 2D plot depicts an x-axis and a y-axis, a map could be a region of the globe or the whole globe forced into 2D depiction (sometimes awkwardly).\nThe coordinate system uses angles called latitudes and longitudes.\n\nThere are fundamentally two types of digital maps:\n\nA vector map or line map is a collection of lines and other such geometric entities which, if drawn like lines typically are, will show a map.\n\nA vector map is most often a very basic map with simple lines for boundaries.\nVector maps are efficient because it doesn’t take much storage space to store lines (you only need the coordinates of the end points of each line).\n\nA tile map is really a collection of tiles put together to form a map:\n\nAn individual tile can itself be an image (as in a ‘satellite view’) or a combination of image and geometric objects.\nTilemaps generally look nicer because tiles can be pre-built with accurate and rich detail.\nHowever, detailed tiles can be slow to load, as you’ve no doubt notice when zooming quickly with Google-maps.\n\n\nBecause of these and other differences, map drawing can sometimes be confusing.\nLet’s look at an example of a simple line-map:\nfrom datatool import datatool\n\ndt = datatool()\n\ndt.load_csv('cities.csv')\n\n# We need to specify which columns of cities.csv have\n# the latitude and longitude, respectively.\ndt.linemap('lat', 'long')\n\ndt.display()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.8\n\n\n\nYou already have cities.csv. Type up the above in my_linemap_example.py and confirm that you see \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nYou need to be connected to the internet because datatool downloads map data from certain websites.\nYou may see an “Aa” legend by the side, depending on which version of Plotly was installed by Anaconda.\nThe CSV file looks like this;\ncity,lat,long,country,iso2,iso3,population\nTokyo,35.6897,139.6922,Japan,JP,JPN,37977000\nJakarta,-6.2146,106.8451,Indonesia,ID,IDN,34540000\nDelhi,28.66,77.23,India,IN,IND,29617000\nMumbai,18.9667,72.8333,India,IN,IND,23355000\nManila,14.5958,120.9772,Philippines,PH,PHL,23088000\nShanghai,31.1667,121.4667,China,CN,CHN,22120000\nSao Paulo,-23.5504,-46.6339,Brazil,BR,BRA,22046000\nSeoul,37.5833,127.0,\"Korea, South\",KR,KOR,21794000\nMexico City,19.4333,-99.1333,Mexico,MX,MEX,20996000\nGuangzhou,23.1288,113.259,China,CN,CHN,20902000\nThe columns that have the latitude and longitude happen to be called lat and long.\nWhich is what we need to tell datatool:\ndt.linemap(&lt;b&gt;'lat', 'long'&lt;/b&gt;)\nDatatool then (via Plotly) draws a world map as default with one red dot per latitude-longitude pair extracted from those columns.\n\n\n\nNext, let’s label the cities and draw a line:\nfrom datatool import datatool\n\ndt = datatool()\n\ndt.load_csv('cities.csv')\n\ndt.linemap('lat', 'long', 'city')\n\n# This needs to come &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; the linemap() function call.\ndt.linemap_add_line(-23.5504,-46.6339, 19.4333,-99.1333)\n\ndt.display()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.9\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_linemap_example2.pyand confirm that you see \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe city labels are crowded and overwrite each other in places. In general, map labeling is a challenging issue.\n\n\nThere is a more detailed version of linemap drawing that allows one to set the size of labels (markers), create “hover” text, and so on:\ndt.linemap_detailed(\n    'lat', \n    'long', \n    marker_color='Red', \n    marker_size=10, \n    marker_text='city', \n    marker_text_size=9, \n    hovertext=['city', 'population'], \n    showlegend=False)"

    "text": "4.3 Using break in loops\nLet’s return to our first example of finding the last square that’s less than 1000.\nRecall what we wrote:\nk = 1\nwhile k*k &lt; 1000:\n  k = k + 1\n\nk = k - 1\nprint('largest square &lt; 1000:', k*k, '= square of', k)\nOne can use a break statement as an alternative to writing the “loop exit” condition as the while condition.\n\nWe’ll first do this with a for-loop, and then see something unusual with the while-loop version.\nTo simplify tracing, let’s rephrase to “largest square less than 50”.\n\nFirst, the for-loop version:\nfor k in range(1, 50):\n  # print('Before-if: k =', k)\n  if k*k &gt; 50:\n      break\n  # print('After-if: k =', k)\n\nk = k - 1\nprint(k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.14\n\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_break.py, removing the # to un-comment the print-statements so that you can see exactly what happens when the if-condition triggers.\nSubmit your program my_break.py.\n\n\n\nLet’s point out some salient features of the break-statement:\n\nA break-statement is the reserved word break all by itself on a line, as seen above.\nWhen a break-statement is executed, Python looks for the loop that encloses the break and abruptly, right there and then, exits the loop.\nThe break-statements are useful to check for conditions that should result in leaving the loop immediately.\nOne could write code like this, but it would make no sense:\nfor k in range(10):\n  print(k)\n  break\nThis would cause the first value (0) to print, and a break right out of the loop.\nAs a mathematical aside, we know that we don’t really need the for-loop range to be as high as 50:\nfor k in range(1, 50):\n  if k*k &gt; 50:\n      break\nAfter all, as k gets close to 50, there is no way k*k would be less than 50. However, we’ll leave it as is, for the sake of simplicity.\nThere are options in writing the loop. Consider the following case:\nfor k in range(1, 50):\n  if (k+1)*(k+1) &gt; 50:\n    print(k)\n    break\nIs this more elegant, if a bit harder to understand at first?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.15\n\n\n\n\nType up the above program in my_break2.py.\nSubmit your program my_break2.py.\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:\n\nTrace the execution of the above program and develop your understanding of how the for-loop and break statements are executed in my_break2.py.\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s look at a while-loop version of the program:\n\nHere’s the code:\nk = 1\nwhile True:\n  if k*k &gt; 50:\n    break\n  k = k + 1\n\nk = k - 1\nprint(k)\nObserve: \nWas it surprising that we deliberately set up a loop to appear to run forever?\nThis is entirely do-able and often desirable, provided we are real careful to set up a condition inside the loop to break out eventually.\nWe need to be sure we hit that condition eventually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.16\n\n\n\n\nThis exercise is to help you develop an understanding of what can go wrong with while-loop execution in the above program.\n\nTry and understand for yourself what would go wrong if the statement k = k + 1 was mistakenly typed in as k = k - 1.\n\nThere is nothing to submit in this exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.17\n\n\n\n\nIn Exercise 4.17, go back to the earlier Exercise 4.12 where you wrote a while loop to print strings of length at least 5, and starting with ‘h’.\nRewrite the while-loop implementing a break-statement instead.\n\nMake a modification in Ex 4.12 to the function func(A) that has a while loop implementation.\nThe modification should print just the first word from the list B that starts with an ‘h’\n\nSave your program as my_break3.py and submit it."

    "text": "4.6 New topic: reading from a file\nVery often, data is collected and stored in files, and so it’s desirable to learn how write code that plucks data right out of such files.\nLet’s start with a simple test file of plain text.\n\nFirst, examine the file testfile.txt to see that it’s a file consisting of four lines of text. (From the poet Ogden Nash.)\n\nWe will look at a few different versions of reading from this file.\n\nHere’s the first example:\nwith open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:\n  lines = in_file.read()\n\nprint(type(lines))\nprint(lines)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.27\n\n\n\n\nType up the above program in my_file_read.py.\nSubmit your program, my_file_read.py.\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:\n\nWhat is the type of the variable lines?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve used two Python reserved words:\nwith open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:\nAlthough file input/output (I/O) does not strictly require the with structure, it is useful because:\n\nFiles that are being accessed by one program are said to be in an “opened” state.\nFor another program to be able access the file, the first one has to “close” it (that is, signal that it’s done with the file).\nThe with structure automatically takes care of it.\n\nThe function call to opentakes the name of the file and the kind of access, for example:\nwith open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:\n\n‘r’ for read-only access (we’re not changing the file here)\n‘w’ for write, if we should choose to.\n\nThe result of opening a file is to get a special kind of variable, what we’ve called in_file in this case:\nwith open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:\nIt is this variable that’s going to perform the reading and, in this case, get us all the text in one shot:\nwith open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:\n  lines = in_file.read()\nNote that all the lines are returned as a single string.\nThis means, it will be difficult to analyze string-by-string, if that’s our goal.\nThere is a way to take the single string and break it into separate lines, but let’s instead find a way to read separate lines.\n\n\n\nAccordingly, let’s look at a way to read the file into a list of strings, where each line is one string in the list:\nlines = []\nwith open('testfile.txt', 'r') as in_file:\n  line = in_file.readline()\n  while line != '':\n    lines.append(line.strip())\n    line = in_file.readline()\n\nprint(type(lines))\nprint(lines)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.28\n\n\n\n\nType up the above program in my_file_read2.py.\nSubmit your program, my_file_read2.py.\nAnswering the following part of the exercise is recommended but not required for submission:\n\nWhat is the type of the variable lines?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nHere, we’re reading one line at a time and appending to a running list, which is the lines variable.\nThe problem is, for any general file, we won’t know in advance how many lines of text are in the file.\nA while-loop to the rescue!\nThus, we keep reading from the file as long as a read operation produces a line: \n\n\n\nWe will now look at how to write to a file.\n\nSuppose we’ve read a text file into a list of strings.\nLet’s now write these to a new file:\nwith open('testcopy.txt', 'w') as out_file:\n  for line in lines:\n    out_file.write(line + '\\n')\nThis time, we’re opening a file called testcopy.txt for the purpose of writing to it:\nwith open('testcopy.txt', 'w') as out_file:\n  for line in lines:\n    out_file.write(line + '\\n')\nWe’ve named our file variable out_file.\nThat will let us use a function called write():\nwith open('testcopy.txt', 'w') as out_file:\n  for line in lines:\n    out_file.write(line + '\\n')\nHere, we’re looping through the list, writing each string as one line in the file.\nNotice that we need to insert the ‘’ at the end of each line.  Recall:\n\n‘\\n’ represents an instruction to both output and files to “go to the next line right now”.\nThus for example\nprint('hello' + 'world')           # Prints helloworld on one line\nprint('hello' + '\\n' + 'world')    # Prints hello, and then world on the next line\n\nSo, to write strings to different lines, we have to tell the function that writes to files to go to the next line with an explicit ‘’.\nIt’s similar with reading, if we read a whole file as one string, that string will contain the so-called linebreaks (the ‘’ characters).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.29\n\n\n\n\nIn my_file_readwrite.py, combine the reading and writing so that the program as whole results in copying from testfile.txt to testcopy.txt.\nSubmit your program, my_file_readwrite.py.\n\n\n\nNext, let’s read from a file of numbers and perform some basic stats:\n\nFirst, examine the file data.txt and see that it’s a collection of numbers, one per line.\nWe’ll read line by line as a string, and then convert to a floating-point number:\ndata = []\nwith open('data.txt', 'r') as in_file:\n  line = in_file.readline()\n  while line != '':\n    s = line.strip()           # Remove leading/trailing whitespace\n    x = float(s)               # Convert string to float\n    data.append(x)             # Add to our list\n    line = in_file.readline()  # Get the next line\n\nprint(data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.30\n\n\n\n\nType up the above program in my_file_data.py.\nAdd code to compute the average of the numbers and print the average.\n\nCompute the total as you iterate in the while-loop.\nThe program should print the average of the data and the data as shown below\n5.485714285714287\n[5.0, 1.3, 6.77, 12.3, 2.01, 3.14, 7.88]"

It’s easy to make a mistake.\n\nThe if-statement combines two conditions using the Boolean operator and:\n\nif x == y and y == z:\n\n\nWe can clarify the parts and combination thereof using parentheses:\n\nif (x == y) and (y == z):\n\nThe two conditions are often called clauses: \n\nYou could also include many more clauses.\n\n\nBoolean is pronounced “BOO lee unn”.\nA Boolean operator takes expressions and evaluates to either True or False.\nThe “and” operator works like this: \n\n\n\nLet’s go back to finding the smallest of three numbers using conditionals:\na = 3\nb = 4\nc = 5\n\n# Fill in code here ... \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.11\n\n\n\nIn my_smallest_of_three2.py, fill in code to identify which of the three variables has the smallest value, depending on the actual values of a, b, and c. Use if-statements with multiple clauses.\n\nTry different values of these variables to verify that your program is working correctly.\nThere is nothing to submit for this exercise.\n\n\n\nThe counterpart to the and operator is the or operator:\na = -2.718\n\nif (a &lt;= 0) or (a &gt;= 1):\n    print('a is not between 0 and 1')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.13\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_boolean2.py.

So, neither of (x == 5) nor (x == 6) is true.\nThus, the whole expression ( (x == 5) or (x ==6) ) is false.\nWhich means not ( (x == 5) or (x ==6) ) evaluates to true.\nTherefore, the print executes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.15\n\n\n\nSuppose integer variables a,b,c,d,e have values a=1, b=1, c=3, d=4, e=5.

(We’ll see how, shortly.)\nNext, execution goes into the function: \nWhen the return statement executes, the value returned (the value of total gets copied into x) \nOne way to think about it is presented below:\n\nConsider the following function invocation:\nx = padd(-5, 6)\nThen look at the function definition and the code block that is executed under def padd(a, b):.\nAfter the function padd(-5, 6) is executed, it returns the value in one of its variables (i.e., total).\nIn this case where the function is padd(-5, 6), the value 6 is returned. \nThe value 6 is now assigned to the the variable x as shown below.\nx = 6\nAnd thus, the value 6 gets copied into the variable x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.10\n\n\n\nIn my_func_example6.py, complete the code in sum_up_to() so that it computes and then returns the sum of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive of 1 and n).\ndef sum_up_to(n):\n    # write your code here\n\nresult = sum_up_to(5)\nprint(result)            # should print 15\nresult = sum_up_to(10)\nprint(result)            # should print 55\n\n\nLet’s return to our earlier example and use the padd() function in different ways:\ndef padd(a, b):\n    print('Received values: ', a, b)\n    total = 0\n    if a &gt;= 0:\n        total += a\n    if b &gt;= 0:\n        total += b\n    return total\n\nprint(padd(-5, 6))                   \nx = padd(padd(-5,6), 7)              \nprint(x)                             \nprint(padd(padd(-5,6), padd(5,-6)))  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.12\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_func_example7.py.\nThen do the following:\n\nExecute the program my_func_example7.py.\nSubmit the program my_func_example7.py.\n\n\n\nLet’s examine each of the last four statements in the program my_func_example7.py:\n\nFirst, let us look at the following statement in the program my_func_example7.py:\nprint(padd(-5, 6))\n\nIn this case, the invocation of the function padd() occurs inside the print() statement.\nThe function padd(-5, 6) executes and returns the value 6.\nThen the print() statement is executed as shown below with the value 6.\nprint( 6 )\nThe value 6 is the output of the print() function.\n\nNext, let us examine the following statement in the program my_func_example7.py:\nx = padd(padd(-5,6), 7)              \n\nIn this case, the innermost padd() function is invoked first, i.e., padd(-5, 6) in\nx = padd( padd(-5,6), 7 )\nThe parameter values 5 & 6 are input into the function padd(-5, 6).\nThe function padd(-5, 6) returns the value 6, and the statement takes the form as shown below:\nx = padd( 6, 7 )\nNow the outermost padd() function has the value values 6 & 7 as its’ parameters.\nThis results in another invocation to padd() with parameter values 6 & 7 i.e., padd( 6, 7 ).\nThe function padd( 6, 7 ) is executed and it returns the value 13.\nThe result is assigned to the variable x as shown below:\nx = 13\n\nFinally, consider the last statement in the program my_func_example7.py as shown below:\nprint(padd(padd(-5,6), padd(5,-6)))  \n\nIn this case, there are two innermost invocations of the padd() functions. These are padd(-5, 6) & padd(5, -6) located inside the outermost padd() function as shown below:\nprint(padd( padd(-5,6), padd(5,-6) ))  \nIn the statement above the first function to be invoked is padd(-5, 6).\nThe function padd(-5, 6) returns the value 6 and the statement takes the following form:\nprint(padd( 6, padd(5,-6) ))  \nNext, the function padd(5, -6) is invoked\nThe function padd(5, -6) returns the value 5 and the statement takes the following form inside the print() statement:\nprint(padd( 6, 5 ))  \nNow, the values 6 & 5 become the parameters for the third invocation of the function padd().\nThis invocation of the function padd( 6, 5 ) returns the value 11\nThe print() statement is now executed with the returned output from the function padd( 6, 5 ) as shown below:\nprint( 11 )  \nAnd so 11 gets sent to print, which prints it.\nWhew!"

Try to read the functions and figure out, not so much the calculation, as what they’re doing.\n\n\nAt first, this looks like a simple exercise in geometric art, or a depiction of the “evil eye” but there’s more to it:\n\nNotice the construction:\n\nWe start with a square.\nThen we inscribe the biggest possible circle that’ll fit inside that square.\nNow we find the biggest possible square that’ll fit inside the recently drawn circle.\nThen the square inscribed in that circle, and so on.\n\nInstead of just using circles and squares, one can use a square first, then a pentagon, then a hexagon, and so on.\nThe result is something that Kepler worked on a long time ago. See this article\nThe historical significance is this:\n\nEver since the Greeks, polygons and circles have held special significance.\nSo, something like this had an almost religious significance.\nKepler then used a similar idea for solids to expound (an entirely wrong) theory of planetary motion.\nTo his credit, he realized he was wrong when shown higher quality data (from Tycho Brahe), and used the data to fit ellipses.\nThis was the beginning of the modern understanding of planetary motion, later mathematically solved by Isaac Newton."

    "text": "Understanding the Basics\nIn the realm of programming, your choice of an editor is pivotal. It serves as your creative hub, where your code takes shape. Here’s a brief overview of key features editors bring to the table:\n\nText Editing: Core to any editor is the ability to write, edit, and organize code. Look for features like syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and code completion for an enhanced coding experience.\nCode Execution: Some editors go beyond editing by enabling interactive code execution, which is handy for data analysis and experimentation.\nExtensions and Plugins: Editors are highly customizable. Enhance functionality by installing extensions or plugins tailored to your needs, adding Python-specific tools or themes.\nIDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Editors offer a complete development environment, including debugging and version control integration.\n\nFor your CS1012 course, we recommend Thonny as the primary choice, with Spyder as a valuable alternative:\n\nThonny: Thonny is a beginner-friendly Python IDE, designed to make it easy to get started with programming. It comes with a simple interface and integrated tools for package management.\nSpyder: Spyder is a powerful IDE for scientific computing and data analysis. It provides features like an interactive console, variable explorer, and integrated help, making it a solid alternative to Thonny.\n\nLet’s dive into the installation process:\n\nSelect an Option Appropriate for Your Operating System\n\n\nMacOS:\n\nStep 1: Install Thonny for Mac\nStep 2: Install Spyder for Mac\n\n\n\nWindows:\n\nStep 1: Install Thonny for Windows\nStep 2: Install Spyder for Windows\n\nChoose Thonny as your primary choice for its simplicity, especially if you’re new to coding. However, if you prefer a more feature-rich environment, Spyder is an excellent alternative.\nFollow the respective installation instructions and embark on your coding journey with confidence!\nOnce you have your preferred editor installed, you’re ready to start coding.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As you will see, it is easy to write a program that runs forever or “gets stuck in an endless loop”.\nSome kinds of “endless” programs will crash on their own because they use up hidden resources on your laptop, which means the operating system (Mac, Windows) will intervene.\nBut it’s equally possible to write a harmless program that merely either just “waits for the user” or is in an endless loop.\nIn either case, it’s very useful to be able to stop a program from continuing to execute.\nThonny users: Thonny already has an easy way to do this from the Run menu: simply click on Interrupt Execution or type control-c (the control key and the c key simultaneously).\nSpyder users: Stopping a running program is a bit more complicated in Spyder because Spyder behaves differently depending on which part of Spyder “has the focus”.\nStep 1: \nBy default, when you write code in Spyder, it’s in the window that says the name of the file (on your screen, you may have chosen for the layout to look slightly different where the file is on the right, or on the bottom or on the top, but the location doesn’t matter for this).\nAs you write code, the outline of that area (called a window) has what is called “focus”, in that when you type something, even ctrl+c, Spyder believes it is meant for that window.\nYou can tell which window has focus because Spyder will outline it in a faint blue line. We’ve drawn in some red arrows to help you see the outline.\nStep 2: \nIf you move your cursor to a different “window”, Spyder will then highlight that window’s outline in a slightly brighter blue to let you know you’ve moved your cursor to a different area. In order to stop a program, the “focus” must be on the output window, called the “IPython Console”, instead of any other window (like the window in which you type your code).\nWe’ve drawn in some more red arrows to highlight Spyder outlining the IPython Console in a lighter blue.\nStep 3: \nAll you need to do to give the IPython Console “focus”, is to click anywhere in that window. Then, you’ll notice that the outline of the window changes slightly. The IPython Console window will be outlined in a faint blue, and the other windows will no longer be outlined.\nWe’ve drawn in some red arrows to show what it looks like when a window has focus (on the right), and some green arrows (on the left) to show what it looks like when a window doesn’t have focus.\nStep 4: \nOnce you’ve clicked anywhere in the IPython Console Window (again, the output window), then, once you press ctrl+c, your program will terminate. If the IPython Console doesn’t have focus when you press ctrl+c, it won’t know you mean to terminate the program, and so it will ignore the ctrl+c."

    "section": "Creating folders",
    "text": "Creating folders\n\n\n\n\nStep 1\n\nTo create a new folder on your desktop (which is the main area of your computer that you see if you have nothing else open. It usually has a nice picture and a couple icons), right click on any open area on your desktop that is not occupied by an icon. You’ll then see the above image pop up, with some minor variations (you might not have “Git GUI Here” or “Git Bash Here”, but you’ll absolutely have the red circled option “new”. Keep your mouse on that option and you’ll see another menu pop up for the different options for a new thing to create:\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n\nThe top option of the new menu shown above should say “Folder”, click on that, and it will create a new folder for you (literally named “New Folder” – unless you have other folders already called “New Folder”, in which case it will call the folder “New Folder (X)” where X is just some number based on how many other new folders you already had existing.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\nAbove is what the “New Folder” should look like! Now, we’re going to rename it with the course name “cs1012”. Shown in the next step:\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n\nRight click on the icon of the new folder that was just created, and you’ll see another menu. Again, you might not see many of the options in the image, but the only option you need is the one near the bottom that says “rename”. Click on that option, and the menu will disappear, and you’ll see the old name of the folder is highlighted in blue, meaning it is ready for you to type a new name for the folder.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\n\nType in “cs1012”, and press enter. If you mistype it, it’s not a problem, just rename the folder again! In that case, you’ll then see “cs1012” highlighted in blue like above rather than “New Folder”.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6\n\nIf you double click on the folder we’ve created and renamed (now called “cs1012”), you’ll see a pop up called “File Explorer”, which is how Windows shows you what files and folders you have.\n\n\n\n\nStep 7\n\nThere are a couple important things to point out:\n“This folder is empty” – we’ll change that shortly.\nThen: “cs1012” – this tells us the name of the folder we are currently looking at, called the “PATH” as well as eventually what other folders are containing it (in this case, since this folder is from our desktop, all we see is cs1012. Once we make a unit0 folder and look at that, we’ll notice the “PATH” says “cs1012 &gt; unit0”, which means we’re inside “unit0”, which is inside “cs1012”, which we know was created inside the desktop).\nHere’s what we need to click on to create our folders! First, click the “Home” button, and you’ll then see the rest of the options shown in the image, like “New Folder”, which is what we want to click on next! It will create a folder again called “New Folder”, which we will rename the same way we renamed cs1012.\n\n\n\n\nStep 8\n\nBy default actually, when you create a new folder it will allow you to type a name for it directly. If you clicked somewhere else just after clicking new folder, then Windows assumes you’ve given the folder the name you want. If you haven’t clicked somewhere else just yet, cool! Type the name “unit0” (with no spaces) and press enter or click somewhere else to complete the renaming.\n\nIf you clicked somewhere else before you had a chance to rename the folder, no worries, there are two ways to rename it. One shown in the image above – you’ll need to right click on the folder and choose “rename”. Or, if you look at the top bar again, just to the left of the “New Folder” button is a button called “rename”. This is the same button! (Just click the folder first once before clicking “rename”, otherwise Windows doesn’t know what item you’re trying to rename.\n\n\n\nStep 9\n\nNow that you have a unit0 folder, repeat the process (steps 7 and 8) for two more folders called “unit1” and “unit2”.\n\n\n\n\nStep 10\n\nDouble click on unit0, and it will bring us inside that folder, where we want to create another new folder, shown in the next step.\n\n\n\n\nStep 11\n\nCreate a folder called module0 (again with no spaces).\n\n\n\n\nStep 12\n\nOnce that’s all set, go down to the bottom left corner of your computer and click on that “Windows” icon. Then, click on the icon of your user (circled – really more like “squared” in red). Then, click on sign out to log out. Then, log back in and let’s find the folders we’ve just made again!\n\n\n\n\nStep 13\n\nNow that you’re logged back in, let’s start back at the desktop. Double click on the cs1012 folder.\n\n\n\n\nStep 14\n\nNow, let’s get back to module0. In the image above there are 3 separate windows to show as steps. First, double click on the “unit0” folder, which will bring you inside where you’ll see module0. Click on “module0”, and you’ll then see “This folder is empty”. Congratulations! You’re back! And don’t worry, we’ll find something to put in module0 soon!"

Here is an example link from module0 exercise2 on learning “Computerese”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThis is an image we’re showing, so don’t click. It is intended to show what it would look like on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n\nRight click on the link itself, and select “save link as”. This will begin saving the file (downloading it) to your computer.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\nNow, you can decide what to call the file and where to save it. The default options are usually to your desktop or downloads folders, but you can navigate directly to one of your module folders and have the file saved there!"

Prior to saving, you’ll notice that the file has some default name, like “untitled” (I’m using Thonny, but the same occurs in Spyder).\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n\nThe most universal way to save a file is as shown above, via going to “File” and then “Save”. This will allow you to not only save the file but name it for the first time. You now have the opportunity to name the file, and select where you want it to be saved. For this demo, I chose my desktop, but usually you will want to save it directly to the module folder it is a part of.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\nYou’ll see that the file now no longer says “untitled”, and instead shows “helloworld.py”, and the location of where the file was saved. (My desktop in this case)\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n\nTo move a file from your desktop into a module folder, start by navigating to a module (like module0), which was shown as the last step in the set of steps for creating the folders you need! Then, click on the python file (if you’re using thonny, your python files will likely have an icon like what you see here. If you’re using spyder, they will have a different icon) and drag it into the module0 folder.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\n\nYou’ll see that the file now is in the module0 folder instead of being shown on your desktop.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6\n\nOnce you’ve saved a file (say to your desktop), you can still pick another location for it (say to a module folder) to be saved via the “save as” option – Note! Save as creates a copy of the file you’re working on, but if you make a change to one version of the file, the other version is not updated with the changes. It’s a better idea to move a file to the new location you want (as shown in step 5) than it is to use save as so that you don’t end up with multiple versions of a file."

You will want to select whatever option mentions “convert to pdf” or “print to pdf”. In this case it’s called “Microsoft Print to PDF”. Rather than this printing out your document, it will create a .pdf file for you.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n\nPress okay, and then give you pdf file a name (it will always be moduleX) where X is the number of the current module. In this case, I’ve named it module0. You do not need to call it “module0.pdf”, Windows will add the “.pdf” for you. In fact, if you do type it, you might find your file is created as “module0.pdf.pdf”. (Fortunately if that happens you can rename the file!)\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\n\nYou will now see the pdf file created in whatever folder it was saved to – in this case I saved mine to my desktop. PDF files usually open in an internet browser. Since my default browser is Google Chrome, my pdf file has a chrome icon.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6\n\nDouble click on the pdf file, and it will open in your default internet browser. Although the pdf creation process is pretty accurate, it’s always a good idea to open your pdf file and read it through to make sure everything looks the way you expect."

Also save the file so that it can be submitted (Remember: you need to save the appropriate files for every such “type up” exercise).\n\n\n\nNow let’s examine key parts of this program:\nFirst, i is the name of a “box” (of sorts).\nThe term used for “box” is variable.    \n⇒ i is a variable.\nTo put something in a variable, we use assignment  \n⇒ with the repurposed = (equals) sign. \nWhen we print a variable, what gets printed is its value.   \n⇒ Thus, the number 5 gets printed \nImportant: What you see on printed out is the number 5 and NOT the letter i\nThus when you see print(i)you should think:\n\n“Hmmm, the print function is going to print the contents of variable i”.\n“I wonder what’s inside i?”\n“Let me look in the program to see what was the most recent value that got written into i”.\n\n\nFor example:\ni = 5\ni = 3\nprint(i)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.2\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_variable_example2.py and confirm that 3 is what gets printed.\n\n\nBy way of explanation: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.3\n\n\n\nIs it possible to not have a value in a variable? Consider this program:\ni\nprint(i)\nType up the program in my_variable_example3.py and run it to check if there are any errors to confirm if it is possible to not have a value in a variable. Submit the program.\n\n\nThus: when you make a variable, you need to put something in it. - Next, let’s look at assignment between variables: - This is the analogue of cloning between “boxes”.\nConsider this program:\ni = 5\nj = i     # The value in i gets copied into j\nprint(j)  # Prints 5\n\nWe say, in short, “i is assigned to j”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe’ve used comments above to annotate and explain.\n\nWe’ll do this often, knowing that comments are not executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.4\n\n\n\nConsider this program:\ni = 5\nj = i\nprint(j)\nprint(i)   # Did i lose its value?\nType up the program in my_variable_example4.py and use comments (text followed by ‘#’ symbol) to describe what happens with print(i). Include ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ at the end of the comment, # Did I lose its value? Submit the python file.\n\n\nThe above example illustrates that the value in i gets copied into the variable j, which means that the value 5 is still in the variable i.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.5\n\n\n\nConsider this program:\ni = 5\nj = i\nk = j\nprint(k)\nTry to identify the output of this program just by mental execution.

So j will have the value 5 as well.\nThe third line replaces the value 5 with value 0.\nj still has 5, so the fourth line will print 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n0 is an actual value, and is not “no value” or “nothing”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4.8\n\n\n\nConsider this program:\nType up the following lines of code in my_variable_example7.py:\ni = 5\nj = 6      \n\n# Add code between here\n\n# and here.\n\nprint(i)   # should print 6\nprint(j)   # should print 5\nAdd some lines of code with the objective of swapping the values in variables i and j.

    "text": "6.0 What are real numbers?\nLet’s start with some math facts:\n\nWhole numbers like 3, 42 and 1024 are integers.  (As an aside: integers include 0 and the negative ones like -2 or -219).\nThe collection of all integers is infinite in size.\nBut integers are limited because some operations on integers do not yield integers:\n\n30 ÷ 5 gives 6, which is an integer.\nBut 31 ÷ 5 is not an integer, yet it’s a quantity.\n\nReal numbers include all the integers but also numbers like 3.141, and -615.2368.\nThe collection of all real numbers is also infinite. Interestingly, it’s a bigger kind of infinite (but that’s a rather subtle math argument outside the scope of this course).\nThe term real is just that: a term that’s came about historically to describe all these numbers.\nYou might wonder: is there any other kind of number?\nTurns out: yes, there a fascinating (and extraordinarily useful) kind of number called an imaginary number, or more generally, a complex number.  (We won’t be working with these in his course.)\nWhat does one do with real numbers?\n\nThe same operations: +, -, *, /\nWhat’s nice is that applying these to real numbers will always result in real number results.\n\nFor example:\nx = 3.14\ny = 2.718\nz = x + y\nprint(z)\n\nw = z * (x + y) / (x - y)\nprint(w)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.1\n\n\n\nType up and submit the above in my_real_example1.py. Confirm that the operations on real number should output a real number in this exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nYou might have seen 5.8580000000000005 as the value of z printed out.\nHowever, you might also have seen something slightly different because of the approximate nature of such calculations, a limitation of computer hardware.\nThese tiny errors are tiny indeed, but vary slightly from one computer to another, generally occuring around the 16th decimal place: 0.00000000000000001\nDo we need to worry about this? Only if we are engaged in complex scientific calculations.\nOccasionally, however, it can matter. For example, if two people calculate mortgage interest (with real consequences) slightly differently, it could lead to a legal conflict.\n\n\n\nQuick review of some relevant math:\n\nOne kind of operation that’s useful is power.\nWe write 26 to mean 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 (six times)\nIt’s easy to see that you could make this work for real numbers that get multiplied: 2.566 = 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56 x 2.56\nBut could you do 26.4? Turns out, yes, you can do this even if it’s not easy to see or intuit. (We would expect 26.4 to be larger than 26 and smaller than 27, which it is.)\nThe next step then is to allow numbers like 2.566.4.\nIn fact, you can take any real number as the mantissa (the 2.56 in 2.566.4) and any real number as the exponent (the 6.4 in 2.566.4).\nLet’s put this in code and introduce a new operator to raise a number to a power, as in 2.566.4).\nx = 2 ** 6\nprint(x)\n\ny = 2.56 ** 6.4\nprint(y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.2\n\n\n\nType up the above in my_real_example2.py.\n\nDon’t submit it yet.\nNow consider the equation 2.56z = y. You need to use Python to provide a real number input to the value z such that the value of y becomes 400.\nType up you lines of Python code to compute the value of y and include them below what you typed already.\nCheck if the value of y is approximately 400 by initalizing the value of z = 6.4.\nYou don’t have to be accurate. Try chaning the value of z to a number greater than 6.4 and then lower than 6.4 to see how close you can get to 400.\nAgain, don’t worry about the correct answer and focus on the syntax and the outout of your program.\nSubmit hte program my_real_example2.py with the value of x that in your attempts gets the value of y closest to 400.\n\n\n\nLet’s explore further:\n\nThe technical term for “what is x that would make 2.56x = 400?” is logarithm.\nWe would say: x = log2.56(400).  (Read this as: x is equal to log of 400 to the base 2.56).\nWe can calculate this directly:\nimport math\n\nx = math.log(400, 2.56)\nprint(x)\nHere we’ve introduced some new concepts: \nJust like you can ask Python to calculate logarithms using math.log, you can do other kinds of “calculator” functions conveniently.\nExample: math.sqrt for square roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.3\n\n\n\nCompute the square root of 2 in this exercise.\nIn my_real_example3.py, fill in code below that prints the square root of the number 2 (and only the square root - just one number).\nimport math\n\n# Write a line of code here\n\nprint(x)"

    "text": "1.2 Strings\nA string in Python is a sequence of letters, digits, or symbols (like $ or *) surrounded by either\n\nA pair of double quotes, as in: \"Hello World!\"\nA pair of single quotes as in: 'Hello World!'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nWhichever quote you use to start a string must be used to end the string.\nThe ending quote must be on the same line as the starting quote.\nThere are special techniques to handle long strings that need to spill over multiple lines (which we’ll see below).\nThis raises some questions:\n\nIs it possible to print a single line but with multiple print statements?\nHow does one print a quote?\n\n\n\n\nFirst, note that we can use single or double quotes for different strings in the same program:\nprint('Hello')\nprint(\"World!\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.6\n\n\n\nConfirm that Hello and World! get printed on two lines by writing the above in my_string_example.py\n\n\nA print statement prints the string within parenthesis and then goes to the next line of output, which is why we see World! on the next line.\nTo keep printing on the same line:\nprint('Hello', end=' ')\nprint('World!')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe’ve reverted to using single-quotes for all strings, which will be our preference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.7\n\n\n\nConfirm by writing the above in my_string_example2.py.\n\n\nWe’ll now go the other way and have a single string itself contain a directive to spill over to the next line.\nprint('Hello\\nWorld!') \nNotice the backslash \\ followed by n inside the string: 'Hello\\nWorld!'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.8\n\n\n\nWrite up the above my_string_example3.py. Run and check if you are getting any errors.\n\n\nStrings can embed special so-called escape sequences that begin with backslash.\nThis will give us one way to print a quote:\nprint('My friend\\'s friend\\'s dog\\'s friend')\nAnother way is to use one set of quotes to delimit the string that are different from the ones used within:\nprint('My friend\\'s friend\\'s dog\\'s friend')\nprint(\"bit my friend's dog's ankle\")\nprint('who yelped \"owww\"')\nHow does one print a backslash itself? By using a double backslash:\nprint('The backslash character, \\\\, is less intimidating now')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.9\n\n\n\nWrite a program called practice_escaping.py that prints out\n  \"    \"   \\\\\\\n  \"    \"    \\    \n  \"\"\"\"\"\"    \\    \n  \"    \"    \\    \n  \"    \"   \\\\\\  \n\n\nAnother use of backslash: to make long strings\n\nSometimes we need to type in a really long string.\nThe following does NOT work:\n\nprint('An Ogden Nash poem:')\nprint('The camel has a single hump; \nThe dromedary, two; \nOr else the other way around. \nI’m never sure. Are you?')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.11\n\n\n\nWrite up a program called my_string_example4.py with the above program and run it. Submit the program. Observe the error the program generates to assess for yourself why the program returns the error.\n\n\n\nTo spread a single string over multiple lines, one uses a triple quote as in:\nprint('An Ogden Nash poem:')\nprint('''The camel has a single hump; \nThe dromedary, two; \nOr else the other way around. \nI’m never sure. Are you?''')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1.12\n\n\n\nWrite up a program called my_string_example5.py with the 5-line limerick above program and run it. Observe that error the program doesn’t not generate an error. Submit the program. Compare this program with Exercise 1.11 to assess why there is no error in this program. You can discuss this program with your TA if you haven’t figured it out for yourself.\n\n\nEmpty strings: - It is possible to not have anything in a string, as in:\nprint('')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are no letters, digits or anything between the two single quotes above.\n\n\n\nSuch a string is called an empty string.\nOdd as it may seem, empty strings are useful (we’ll see later) when you want to add strings to make a longer string."

Also save the file so that it can be submitted (You will need to save the appropriate files for everysuch “type up” exercise).\n\n\nLet’s point out a few things: \n\nLet’s start by distinguishing between a function definition (which uses def and merely tells Python what the function is about), and invocation (which asks Python to execute the function at that moment).\n\nA function definition is a piece of code that begins with the word def\nA function definition is sometimes also called function declaration.\nA function definition does not execute the code immediately.\nInstead it’s like saving in one place a bunch of instructions that can be invoked with just the name of the function.\nThis saves writing lots of code if a group of code can begiven a name (in this case, a function name).\n\nA function definition has 5 elements: \nA function with a given name is defined just once.\nA function invocation merely uses the name, along with parentheses:\nprint_big_M()\nWe’ll later see examples where some things can go between the parens.\nWhile a particular function is defined once, it can be used any number of times:\n\nIn fact, that is the whole purpose of defining functions.\nEach use of a function is a single line of code, which saves us the trouble of rewriting all the code that was inside the function for each time we need it.\n\nFunction definitions also help isolate code so that one doesn’t have to see or understand what’s inside to use it.\nWe’ve already used such a function before: the print function.\n\nThe printfunction is defined internal to Python.\nWe don’t type its definition, nor do we see it.\nWe just use it as often as we like.\n\nImportant: Please pay careful attention to indentation\n\nThe line that begins with def should NOT be indented.\nOther lines that belong to the function should be indented.\nThere are other forms of indentation that we’ll point out as we proceed - they’re all important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3\n\n\n\nWrite your own animal sound that uses one function at least thrice with an exclamation mark at the end, e.g. print the big version of BAAA!. Write your code in my_pet_sound.py. Once your program is working, say the sound out aloud to celebrate. (Why not?)\n\n\nNext, let’s see how functions “work” by making a small change to the program:\ndef print_big_M():\n    print('*   *')\n    print('** **')\n    print('* * *')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*   *')\n\ndef print_big_O():\n    print('*****')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*   *')\n    print('*****')\n\nprint('Step 1')\nprint_big_M()\nprint('Step 8')\nprint_big_O()\nprint('Step x')\nprint_big_O()\nprint('Step y')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.4\n\n\n\nType up the above in animal_sounds2.py and run it.\n\n\nLet’s explain using an analogy: \n\nWe’ll use the analogy of a house to describe a program and its parts (the functions).\nA program’s execution starts at the very top.\nIn the above case, there are a number of definitions:\n\nDefinitions are merely “processed” but not executed.\nIt’s understood that the definitions may be invoked later.\nIn our house analogy, we walk past these “rooms” to the main lobby.\n\nThe first real line of code is the print('Step 1')statement.\n\nThink of this section of code as the “main lobby”.\n\nAfter this, we see the line (also a command) print_big_M()\n\nThis is an instruction that causes the computer to “go to the print_big_M()room”.\nWe then head to that room and start executing commands in there.\n\nThus, the third command that gets executed is print('*   *')\nWe’re still in the room with more commands to go, and the next one (4th so far) is print('** **')\nContinuing, we execute the last line in the room, which will make this the 7th one executed.\nAfter we leave the “room”, and this is important, we continue execution after the invocation that brought us to the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.5\n\n\n\nAt which step (which step number) do we execute the last line in print_big_O? And then, at which step do we enter print_big_O the second time and print its first line? In animal_sounds3.py replace x and y with the correct step number. Use comments (text followed by ‘#’ symbol) to describe your answer."
